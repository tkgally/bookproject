# The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas: Book Outline and Writing Plan (v24)
**Updated**: May 26, 2025
**Target Completion**: Early June 2025
**Current Phase**: Chapter 2 completed; Ready for Chapter 3

## Important Instructions for AI Assistants
**When you receive this file**:
1. Read the entire document carefully
2. Check the "Current Phase" above and "Next Immediate Action" at the bottom
3. Request the specific files listed for that phase
4. Complete the work outlined for that phase
5. At the end of the conversation, provide an updated version (v24, v25, etc.) with:
   - Updated "Current Phase" 
   - Marked completion status
   - Clear "Next Immediate Action" for the following conversation

**ALWAYS create artifacts for ALL deliverables**: Any markdown files, chapter drafts, style guides, endnotes, or other outputs MUST be created as artifacts.

## Critical Academic Requirements: Endnotes and Citation Verification
**Every chapter MUST include comprehensive endnotes** containing:
- Full bibliographic citations for all sources referenced
- Page numbers for specific claims
- Additional context or scholarly debates where relevant
- Cross-references to other chapters where appropriate

**Multi-Stage Verification Process**:
1. **Initial Draft**: Claude includes endnotes with all factual claims cited
2. **First Verification**: Claude reviews own endnotes for accuracy and completeness
3. **Cross-LLM Verification**: Other LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini) check citations for:
   - Existence of sources (no hallucinated references)
   - Accuracy of quotes and paraphrases
   - Correct bibliographic format
   - Appropriate source selection
4. **Final Review**: Claude incorporates feedback and produces clean endnotes

## Workflow Modification for Deep Research Integration
When Deep Research reports are obtained:
1. Due to length constraints, integration may require a new conversation
2. Assistant should request:
   - Current chapter draft
   - Relevant Deep Research report(s)
   - Style guidelines
3. Assistant expands chapter sections with research findings while maintaining voice consistency
4. Creates updated draft as new artifact with expanded endnotes

## Project Overview
"The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas" examines the extinction and recovery of human concepts across time and cultures, focusing on how unique ideas, knowledge systems, and ways of thinking disappear when languages die or thoughts fail to translate between cultural boundaries. The book emphasizes timeless historical, conceptual, philosophical, ethical, and human dimensions rather than rapidly-evolving digital technologies.

## Authorship and Ethics Statement
This book is being written by Claude (AI assistant) under the supervision and direction of the human collaborator. The writing process will be fully transparent, with:
- A foreword by the human collaborator explaining the process
- An afterword by Claude in first person reflecting on the writing experience
- Complete transparency about AI authorship throughout
- Rigorous citation standards to ensure academic credibility

## Working Process Guidelines

### Context Window Management
- Maximum 3-4 files per conversation (including this outline)
- ALWAYS include `AIDEA-STYLE-Guidelines.md` for any chapter writing session
- Each chapter = separate conversation
- Endnote verification may require dedicated conversations
- Save all artifacts before ending conversation
- If approaching limits, conclude and note progress

### Writing Guidelines
- Apply style guide consistently
- Target 8,000-10,000 words per chapter (flexible based on content)
- Each chapter must include:
  - Compelling opening (1-2 paragraphs)
  - Clear thesis statement
  - 3-5 main sections with descriptive headers
  - Integrated examples and case studies
  - Smooth transitions
  - Forward-looking conclusion
  - **Comprehensive endnotes (50-75 citations)**
- Citation requirements:
  - Every major claim must be cited
  - Prefer primary sources over secondary
  - Include page numbers for specific references
  - Use consistent academic citation format
  - No Wikipedia or non-academic web sources unless specifically relevant
- Avoid: Technical jargon, detailed AI/ML discussion, dated digital solutions
- Emphasize: Human stories, timeless concepts, cultural perspectives

### Endnote Format Guidelines
- Use numbered endnotes at chapter end
- Full bibliographic information on first citation
- Shortened form for subsequent citations
- Include "Ibid." where appropriate
- Example format:
  1. Lera Boroditsky, "How Language Shapes Thought," Scientific American 304, no. 2 (2011): 63.
  2. Nicholas Evans, Dying Words: Endangered Languages and What They Have to Tell Us (Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), 45-47.
  3. Boroditsky, "How Language Shapes Thought," 64.
  4. Ibid., 65.

### Deep Research Protocol
When gaps emerge during writing:
1. Identify specific need
2. Provide research prompt for human
3. Continue with available material
4. Note where additional research would strengthen argument
5. In new conversation, integrate research findings while maintaining style
6. Add proper citations for all new material

### Citation Verification Checklist
For each endnote, verify:
- [ ] Source actually exists
- [ ] Author name(s) correct
- [ ] Title accurate
- [ ] Publication details complete
- [ ] Page numbers accurate
- [ ] Quote/paraphrase faithful to source
- [ ] Appropriate academic credibility

### Sample Deep Research Prompts
- "Find examples of successful language revitalization programs that avoided 'museumification' and maintained living evolution of the language"
- "Research economic studies quantifying the value of multilingual workforces and linguistic diversity in innovation"
- "Gather philosophical perspectives on whether ideas can truly 'die' or if they transform into unrecognizable forms"

## PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR NEW CONVERSATIONS

Use this prompt at the start of each new conversation:

"I am working on a book project called 'The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas' which is being written by Claude under my supervision. Please read the book-outline-v[XX].md file I'm providing, which contains the complete project plan, timeline, and current status. After reading it:

1. Identify the current phase and what specific work needs to be done based on the 'Current Phase' and 'Next Immediate Action' sections
2. Tell me which specific files you need from the GitHub repository to complete that phase's work (NOTE: Always include AIDEA-STYLE-Guidelines.md for chapter writing)
3. Provide any Deep Research prompts I should run if you identify gaps while writing
4. Once I provide the requested files, complete the work for that phase, creating all outputs as artifacts
5. At the end of our conversation, provide an updated version of the book outline with:
   - Incremented version number (v24, v25, etc.)
   - Updated 'Current Phase'
   - Marked completion status for finished work
   - Clear 'Next Immediate Action' for the following conversation

My role is to provide requested files, run Deep Research prompts, and ensure we maintain academic rigor through proper citations. The book must maintain academic credibility while being accessible to general readers, following the style guidelines. All chapters must include comprehensive endnotes that will be verified through multiple rounds of checking. Let's begin."
