   - Resources redirected to basic defense

### Craft and Luxury Goods

#### Market Value Destruction
1. **Stradivarius instruments**:
   - Originals worth millions
   - Modern copies fraction of value
   - Performance quality gap

2. **Ru ware ceramics**:
   - 100 pieces serving global demand
   - Modern attempts lack prestige
   - Cultural capital concentrated

## Opportunity Costs

### Innovation Pathways Closed

#### Alternative Development Trajectories
1. **Mechanical computation** (Antikythera):
   - 1400-year delay in complexity
   - Different calculation methods developed
   - Potential early industrialization lost

2. **Material science** (Roman concrete):
   - Sustainable building delayed
   - Chemical understanding gaps
   - Environmental solutions missed

### Knowledge Compound Effects

#### Lost Learning Curves
1. **Generational improvement**:
   - Each generation builds on previous
   - Loss resets to zero
   - Centuries to regain equivalent

2. **Cross-domain fertilization**:
   - Technologies inspire others
   - Networks effects eliminated
   - Innovation ecosystems disrupted

### Human Capital Destruction

#### Skill Development Losses
1. **Master craftsmen elimination**:
   - Decades of training wasted
   - Teaching capacity destroyed
   - Quality standards lost

2. **Economic mobility paths**:
   - Craft careers eliminated
   - Social advancement routes closed
   - Regional specializations ended

## Modern Economic Parallels

### Contemporary Technology Risks

#### Potential Future Losses
1. **Manufacturing knowledge**:
   - Offshoring creating vulnerabilities
   - Single-source dependencies
   - Skill attrition in developed nations

2. **Digital preservation costs**:
   - Format obsolescence expenses
   - Migration requirements
   - Access loss economic impact

### Valuation Challenges

#### Pricing Lost Knowledge
1. **Direct replacement costs**:
