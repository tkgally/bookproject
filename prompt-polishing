I am working on enhancing Chapters 2 and 3 of "The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas" for an upcoming talk. This is a temporary branch focused on integrating deep research findings and ensuring citation accuracy. Please read the branch-outline-v[XX].md file I'm providing carefully and completely - it contains essential information about the book's themes, approach, and style that you'll need to maintain consistency.
After reading the entire outline:

1. Confirm you understand the book's core thesis and approach
2. Identify the current phase based on the "Current Phase" section
3. Tell me which specific files you need to complete that phase's work
4. Once I provide the files, complete the work as specified, creating all outputs as artifacts
5. If approaching context limits, note progress and prepare clear instructions for the next conversation
6. At the end, provide an updated branch outline with incremented version number and updated status

Key constraints:

- Chapter expansion must not exceed 20% of original length
- All additions must maintain the established style and flow
- Every citation must be verifiable and correctly formatted
- The goal is academic rigor without sacrificing readability
- Enhancements must support the book's core thesis about conceptual extinction

My role is to provide requested files and facilitate the multi-LLM verification process. Let's begin.
