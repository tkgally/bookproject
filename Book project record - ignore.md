Book project record

## March 16

### Prompt to Claude
I am going to be starting a project with you that I will continue for several weeks. This will be a long-term research project in which I brainstorm ideas for a book-length research project and work together with you and with other large language models to develop the ideas, conduct the research, and write up the results in a book-length manuscript. I'm going to keep all of the project files a folder on my desktop called Book project. Please develop an outline of a plan for how I can go about doing this project. Put your outline into a markdown file and save it to that book project folder. I will be asking you to update that markdown file occasionally, so please include instructions in that file explaining what the project is so that I start new conversations with you or other LLMs by uploading that markdown file. Include sections within the document explaining how the related files are organized within that folder and any other higher level control information that would be appropriate for such an extended writing and research project. This parent markdown file itself will evolve as the project evolves.

Result: Spent a few hours on the project, but the Claude desktop app kept dropping connections, so decided to do the project manually.

### User Prompt:
My research interests in general are in the area of language. My own background is as a translator from Japanese to English, and also working as an academic and researcher at the University of Tokyo, in which I supervised research on topics like language education. language ideology and lexicography. For this project, I want to look into and pursue research on a project related to language, language ideology, ethics, and economics. My name is Tom Gally, and I have added an essay I wrote a few years ago about Ethics and Language education to the Resources folder. I have also added two essays (in the same file) that I wrote in Japanese about fifteen years ago. For the current project, I want to pursue some new topic related in general to these issues but more extensively and rigorously. My purpose is to create a book that would be both academically valuable and interesting and enlightening for people to read. So the research should be new and original and have both academic and general intellectual value. So I want to begin the brainstorming process now. Can you suggest, say, 20 possible topics that draw on these interests that I've expressed to you, but that have some degree of specificity? As I will be involved in the writing of them, it might also be good if it has some connection to Japan or the Japanese language, as those have been where much my interest has been. I will be writing the book in English, but it can draw on resources in Japanese as well as in English.

### Claude's Response Summary:
- Read Tom's essays on language economics and multilingual costs from the Resources folder
- Generated 20 specific research topics combining language, ideology, ethics, and economics
- Emphasized topics with Japan/Japanese language connections
- Created topics ranging from language economics in global business to translation ethics, technology impacts, and social justice issues
- Organized topics by theme (economics, ideology, translation ethics, education, technology, policy, cultural production)
- Saved comprehensive brainstorming session to planning folder
- Topics designed to combine academic rigor with broader intellectual appeal
- Each topic offers potential for original empirical research building on Tom's expertise

### Claude suggested the topics in research_topics_brainstorm_may16.md

### My response

Okay, let's talk about those 20 ideas you suggested as brainstorming. Those are all interesting topics to me, but they all seem a little bit typical. Or they are the sorts of projects I've seen in other academic research projects. Also, I'm not that interested in topics related to things like social justice or cultural capital. I'm more interested in philosophical and conceptual issues related to language, ethics, and economics. Please suggest 20 more topics that are a little bit more ambitious and perhaps abstract in the sense of not focusing so narrowly on a specific problem. Also, for this book, I don't think I will be doing any field research at all. So the research will have to be done purely based on online sources or on books that I can convert to text as well as on my own original thoughts (aided, of course, by LLMs!). But even more important, I want it to be incisive and original work of contemplation and thought and philosophy while still grounded in empirical facts. It would be especially good if the topics you suggest are the sorts of things that would emerge only through collaboration between a human, meaning myself, and very intelligent and knowledgeable large language models, such as yourself, that also have access to the internet and can read and synthesize and integrate and extend upon. many different sources.

### Claude suggested the new topics in philosophical_topics_brainstorm_may16.md

### I chose the following and got prompts from Claude for four of them. Sample: I am researching a concept I call "Linguistic Dark Matter" - the meanings, concepts, and ways of being that exist in the spaces between formal languages and how this affects economic exchange, innovation, and value creation.
Please conduct extensive research to find:
Academic Sources:
- Linguistic anthropology papers on untranslatable concepts
- Philosophy of language works on meaning that exists outside formal linguistic expression
- Economic anthropology on non-monetary forms of value exchange
- Cognitive science research on concepts that exist pre-linguistically or between languages
- Translation studies on what is necessarily lost or created in translation
Non-Academic Sources:
- Accounts by translators, interpreters, and polyglots about "untranslatable" moments
- Business cases where cross-cultural misunderstanding led to economic loss or gain
- Examples from international negotiation, diplomacy, and trade
- Literature and poetry that explicitly deals with linguistic impossibility
- Digital humanities projects mapping linguistic diversity and gaps
Key Research Questions to Explore:
1. What theoretical frameworks exist for understanding meaning that exists outside formal language?
2. How do economists account for value that cannot be linguistically articulated?
3. What are documented cases of economic innovation emerging from linguistic gaps?
4. How do different philosophical traditions conceptualize "pre-linguistic" or "trans-linguistic" meaning?
5. What digital tools or methods exist for detecting or mapping semantic gaps between languages?
Conceptual Organization:
Please organize your findings into themes such as:
- Theoretical frameworks for non-linguistic meaning
- Economic implications of untranslatable concepts
- Case studies of linguistic dark matter in practice
- Methodological approaches to studying semantic gaps
- Connections to complexity theory, emergence, and value creation
Research Avenues:
Based on your findings, suggest specific research directions that could:
- Develop new theoretical frameworks bridging linguistics and economics
- Create practical tools for detecting and working with linguistic dark matter
- Explore philosophical implications for human consciousness and meaning-making
- Investigate policy implications for international trade and cultural exchange

### I used Claude’s prompts to get deep research reports from ChatGPT o3, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro for four topics: 

The Topology of Untranslatability
Palimpsest Economics
Archaeology of Deleted Ideas
Linguistic Dark Matter

## May 17

I decided to go with "Archaeology of Deleted Ideas," as it seemed interesting to me and there were no Google hits for the phrase.

### Prompt to Claude (dictated and then revised)

I am beginning an ambitious research and writing project in which I will collaborate with several large language models to write a book-length original work of intellectual depth. In this book, we will have an original overarching theme that we will pursue through both discussions of previous research and writings from a variety of fields related to that theme and do original analysis and discussion related to other texts, with the word "text" being used broadly to refer not only to written texts but to other forms of media and information. The title of this book will be “The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas.” I have received reports on this topic from two large language models. I have attached those reports to this prompt.

Here is what I want you to do now. One, read through these three reports and understand their content and ideas. Two, open an artifact and write an outline and writing plan for this book. The outline should list the chapter titles and a one-paragraph description of the content of each chapter. The content of this book should be both academically rigorous and interesting and engaging for an intelligent reader to read. Therefore, the book's narrative should flow smoothly throughout the entire book, with each chapter leading to the next, and the reader will be drawn through it by the fascination and excitement of the ideas and information presented. The concluding chapter will draw all of the ideas presented in the book together into a satisfying and well-argued conclusion that also points to directions for future research and discussion. The book will be written in the third person, with no personal references to the author. In addition to the chapter-by-chapter outline, also at the beginning of the document include a one-paragraph summary of the book. Then, after the chapter outline, include a research and writing plan for the writing of the book. In this writing, assume that nearly all of the research and writing, as well as the conceptualization of the ideas, will be done by the large language models that I am working with. Each task along the way should be phrased as something that I can tell the large language models do, such as gather previous research and other writings, read, synthesize, and analyze what others have written, choose new texts for analysis, conduct those analyses, write the drafts of each chapter, read and evaluate and revise those drafts, and then do a comprehensive check and revision of the entire manuscript to make sure that it is tightly written, has a consistent style and voice, is well-structured and engaging to the reader, rigorous in its citations and references to other writings, aware of the limitations of its approach, etc.

In this writing plan, describe the tasks only briefly. As I move ahead on the project, I will use this plan as the basis for asking LLMs to write more complete prompts. I do not need those prompts yet.

After you have written this summary, outline, and writing plan, go through repeatedly to double-check it, improve it, and tighten it.

Attached as the outline of a book project I am now working on together with multiple LLMs. After the chapter outline is a list of phases for this project. I have completed phase 1 and two reports that were produced by Gemini and chatgpt for Phase 1 are also attached. I now want to move ahead to the first item under phase 2, that is, "1. Direct LLMs to gather documented examples of lost knowledge, technologies, and concepts from academic sources across multiple disciplines." Please provide a complete prompt that I can give to large language models that have deep research capability in order for them to complete thoroughly the task given under this item.

Note: The first two times I ran the prompt through Gemini it started producing a report on a completely different topic. I removed a markdown header at the beginning of the prompt, and it worked then.

### Prompt to Claude to modify writing plan

Attached is the outline of a book project that I had you produce earlier. The project is moving ahead well, and two LLMs are now working on Phase 2-2. Please revise this outline as follows: (1) Mark all of Phase 1 and Phase 2-1 as complete. (2) After Phase 2, add a new Phase 3 in which the LLMs start compiling a set of markdown documents containing complete notes about all of the information gathered. Those notes will contain quotations, citations of information, comments from the LLMs about additional information that needs to be gather, tentative analyses of the information gathered, etc. There should be one markdown document for each of the main themes. Devise a transparent naming scheme for those documents. (3) Before the chapter drafting begins, add a stage in which those markdown notes are evaluated and reorganized, with additional comments that will be useful for the writing process. (4) Before the chapter drafting begins, add a step in which the LLMs are asked to look for examples of writing styles of similar books. I will then choose one or more of those writing styles as a model for the writing style of this book. (5) Note somewhere that the final version of this book will use endnotes without in-text citations. During the drafting, in-text citations will be used, but in the final draft the in-text citations will be removed and the endnotes will be revised so that there are explanations of what is being cited and quoted followed by a valid reference to the source. The purpose of this citation method is to make the text more readable with fewer distractions while still maintaining academic rigor. (6) Add one or two additional citation and fact verification steps conducted by the LLMs earlier than Phase 9.  (7) Renumber the phases as appropriate. Open the revised document in an Artifact.
