# AIDEA-METH-03: Digital and Computational Methods

## Overview
Digital humanities and computational approaches have revolutionized the study of deleted ideas, offering unprecedented capabilities for detection, analysis, and preservation. This document details specific digital and computational methodologies applicable to excavating lost conceptual systems.

## 1. Text Mining and Corpus Analysis

### 1.1 Large-Scale Pattern Detection
**Source**: Claude report, ChatGPT report, Gemini report

**Core Capabilities**:
- Analyzing millions of documents simultaneously
- Tracking conceptual presence/absence over time
- Identifying semantic shifts and meaning changes
- Detecting "conceptual holes" in discourse

**Specific Techniques**:

**Frequency Analysis**:
- Using Google Books Ngram Viewer to track term frequency over centuries
- Identifying when concepts "fall off a cliff" in usage
- Detecting revivals of previously dormant concepts

**Example**: "Tracking 'phlogiston' shows it virtually disappeared by the 19th century after the chemical revolution, marking the deletion of that scientific idea."

**Collocation Analysis**:
- Examining which words appear together
- Tracking changes in conceptual associations
- Identifying when concepts become isolated before disappearing

**Semantic Prosody Analysis**:
- Detecting shifts in connotation (positive to negative)
- Identifying when concepts acquire "toxic" associations
- Tracking emotional valence changes that precede deletion

### 1.2 Topic Modeling
**Source**: Claude report, Gemini report

**Applications**:
- Discovering latent themes in historical corpora
- Identifying conceptual clusters that have disappeared
- Tracking topic evolution and death over time
- Finding "orphaned" topics with no modern equivalent

**Example Application**: "Topic modeling on 18th-century journals might uncover a latent topic about 'electric fluid'—an early concept of electricity that later got reframed."

### 1.3 Distant Reading
**Source**: Claude report

Franco Moretti's approach applied to deleted ideas:
- Analyzing patterns across thousands of texts
- Identifying macro-level conceptual trends
- Detecting systemic conceptual shifts
- Mapping "conceptual dark ages" where ideas vanish

**Key Insight**: "More data doesn't always mean more knowledge retention—the sheer overload can bury things (signal-to-noise problem)."
