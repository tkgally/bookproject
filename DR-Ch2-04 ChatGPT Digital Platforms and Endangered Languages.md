# Digital Platforms and Endangered Languages: Constraints and Catalysts

## Introduction

Digital communication tools have become a double-edged sword for endangered languages. On one hand, social media and messaging platforms offer new domains for using and teaching these languages; on the other, certain platform features can unintentionally hinder their use. Features such as strict character limits, ubiquitous emoji sets, and autocorrect algorithms all influence how minority language speakers communicate online. This report investigates how these elements affect language preservation and evolution. We explore challenges (like forced brevity or lack of keyboard support) and opportunities (creative adaptations and community-building) in platforms ranging from Twitter/X and Facebook to WhatsApp, TikTok, and Instagram. We also highlight real-world examples of communities adapting their endangered languages to digital spaces, and summarize academic findings on the impact of online communication on language visibility and change.

## Character Limits and Text Constraints

Many platforms impose limits on message length - famously, Twitter (now X) long restricted tweets to 140 characters (later 280). Such character limits compel users to condense their thoughts, often by using abbreviations, acronyms, or clipped grammar [1, 2]. Linguists have observed that "textese" (the terse style born from SMS and tweets) omits parts of speech and uses creative shortenings without losing meaning [3, 4]. For example, constrained messages tend to drop articles and vowels or use homophones (e.g. "gr8" for "great") [2]. This economy of expression is a mixed blessing for endangered languages.

**Challenges:** For some minority languages, words can be long or require complex spelling, so strict length limits may discourage full expression. Speakers might switch to a dominant language for brevity or leave out diacritical marks and characters unique to their language. In Welsh Twitter posts, for instance, users often mix in English and simplify spellings to fit the 140-character tweet format, resulting in an informal style that mirrors speech [5, 6]. Concerns arise that constantly "trading in fully formed words for abbreviations" could erode linguistic richness [7, 8]. Inuktitut researchers have noted a decline in formal grammar and vocabulary, partly due to the influence of English media and the tendency to mix Inuktitut with English online [9]. These trends suggest that digital brevity might lead to simplified grammar and code-mixing in endangered languages over time.

**Opportunities:** Conversely, character limits can spark creative adaptations that keep a language fresh and relevant. A recent study of the Tengger Javanese community on WhatsApp found users employing orthographic and phonological abbreviations in their texts as a form of creative expression, effectively developing new written forms that reflect how they speak [10]. Rather than harming the language, these text-based innovations were seen as a way to revitalize usage by making online communication faster and more fun for young speakers [11]. Similarly, linguist Johanneke Sytsema notes that on platforms like Facebook or Twitter, "young people text each other how they speak, even if they don't know how to spell it", thus practicing their minority language informally [12]. In this way, user-generated abbreviations and slang can preserve an endangered language's presence in daily life, even if it diverges from formal norms. Researchers have even leveraged tweet corpora to study language evolution - for example, a Welsh linguistics project uses Twitter's short, colloquial messages to capture emerging constructions in real time [6]. The informal 140-character snapshot of language reveals the dynamics of an evolving tongue and can inform educators and revitalization efforts [5, 13]. Overall, while character limits pose challenges by constraining expression, they also encourage inventive language use that keeps endangered languages visible and engaging for younger generations.

## Emojis and Visual Communication

Emoji characters - from üòÉ and üò° to ‚ù§Ô∏è and ‚ú® - have become a universal adjunct to text. For endangered languages, emoji systems present both a visual aid and a potential crutch. By conveying emotions or common objects pictographically, emojis can transcend written language barriers and allow speakers to communicate feelings without perfect spelling or extensive vocabulary. For example, an emoji like üòÑ can replace the phrase "I am happy," saving space and bridging literacy gaps [2]. This can support language preservation by letting less fluent users participate in digital conversations without resorting to a dominant language for every expression. Emojis also add flavor to posts in any language, helping indigenous language content grab attention in crowded social feeds.

However, heavy reliance on emojis might hinder language use if visuals start substituting for words entirely. If a concept is always conveyed with an emoji (for instance, using üî• instead of the indigenous word for "fire"), speakers get fewer chances to practice the actual word. That said, many communities have turned the emoji trend into an opportunity by customizing it for their languages. Culturally tailored emoji sets and stickers have emerged as a novel form of language preservation. Indigenous digital activists in Latin America, for example, created their own emoji collections to reflect their heritage - Mapuche-themed emojis wearing traditional attire and phrases, or Huastec (T√©nek) emoji stickers depicting local symbols [14, 15]. Rather than wait for tech companies to be inclusive, these communities designed images that embed their languages into daily messaging [16].

*Mapuche-themed emojis created by indigenous activists, featuring greetings in the Mapudungun language. These custom emoji sets blend visual culture with text to engage young users. [14, 15]*

A particularly powerful example is the Kaytetyemoji project in Australia, which transformed 112 words of the endangered Kaytetye language into emoji-like stickers with audio. Elders worked with technologists to develop 44 new emojis unique to Kaytetye life, each accompanied by a recording of the word being spoken and used in a sample phrase [17, 18]. By packaging indigenous words as tappable icons - from local animals to culturally important landmarks ‚Äì they found a way to "fit [the language] into young people's lives", meeting digital natives on their own turf [19, 20]. The Kaytetyemoji app not only preserves vocabulary but also encourages youth to send messages in their language, effectively passing it down through a modern medium. Similar projects (Arrentemoji for the Arrernte language, emojis for Navajo, etc.) illustrate how emoji systems, when expanded to include indigenous content, can bolster pride and visibility for endangered languages.

Of course, mainstream platforms have started to respond as well. Major emoji libraries now include more diverse skin tones and some regional symbols, and there are ongoing petitions for including specific cultural symbols. While a generic smiley is language-agnostic, a custom emoji with an indigenous greeting or motif can spark curiosity and conversations about that language. In summary, emojis by themselves neither save nor sink a language ‚Äì it's how communities harness them. The opportunity lies in using emojis as a supplement to words: a colorful hook that draws people in and reinforces meaning (especially for visual learners). The challenge is ensuring that emojis encourage users to learn the words behind the images, keeping the written language alive and not entirely replaced by cartoons.

## Autocorrect, Keyboards, and Script Support

Anyone who has typed in a minority language on a phone or computer knows the struggle of autocorrect. Most default autocorrect and predictive text systems are trained on major languages; when a user tries to write in an endangered language, the software might underline every word in red or "correct" it to something else entirely. This lack of digital support is a significant hindrance to language maintenance. If sending a simple text in MƒÅori or Ojibwe requires fighting autocorrect at every turn, users may give up and switch to English for convenience. In bilingual communities, some describe autocorrect as ‚Äúa curse" because it intrudes on multi-language conversations, often inserting the wrong words unless one constantly changes settings. Moreover, many endangered languages have special characters or diacritics not found in English. Without proper keyboard layouts and fonts, users either omit these marks (which can alter meaning or make text harder to read) or install custom keyboards ‚Äì an extra step not all are willing or able to take.

Encouragingly, there have been major strides in keyboard and spell-check support for smaller languages. Tech companies and language advocates are collaborating to add more languages to digital platforms. For instance, Facebook's interface is now offered in over 100 languages, including indigenous ones like Cherokee, Quechua, and (as of 2022) Inuktitut [21, 22]. The addition of Inuktitut (Canadian Inuit language) to Facebook's UI was intended "to help promote the daily usage of Inuktitut‚Äù online, recognizing that Facebook is the most-used network in Nunavut [23]. On the mobile front, custom keyboard apps have filled important gaps. Navajo, a Native American language, lacked comprehensive mobile support until a dedicated Navajo Keyboard app was developed. This app includes all Navajo characters and even pre-made phrases, allowing users to easily text and post in Navajo without fighting English-centric autocorrect [24, 25]. The creator, Jerome Tsosie, noted that because "the younger generation [is] all digital...it gives an opportunity for anyone out there who's wanting to learn to start texting in Navajo and start posting things in Navajo on social media" [26]. In other words, good tools lower the barrier to using the language daily, which is crucial for its preservation.

When autocorrect and predictive text do support an endangered language, they can actually reinforce correct spelling and common usage. Users get real-time feedback and suggestions in their language, making the typing experience smoother and perhaps teaching them new words. For example, smartphone keyboards now support languages like Welsh and Basque, offering predictive text that suggests native words as you type. This helps normalize the language in digital conversations and can enrich vocabulary for learners. There is also experimental AI research into building spell-checkers and predictive models for low-resource languages with very little data [27, 28]. As these models improve, we may see autocorrect become an ally rather than an obstacle in endangered language communication.

Script support is another critical factor. Some endangered languages use unique writing systems (e.g., Cherokee syllabary, Brahmic scripts, etc.). If a platform cannot render those scripts, users might resort to transliteration (writing the language with Latin letters). While transliteration allows communication, it can distance writers from the authentic script and spelling of their language. Thankfully, Unicode and modern operating systems now cover a vast array of scripts, and initiatives like Google's Noto Fonts aim to ensure no language's script is "missing" on computers. A recent example is the Louisiana Creole community, which lacked a widely accepted writing system. Through a Facebook-based revitalization group, speakers collectively developed an orthography for Creole and used it in posts; this new writing system gained widespread acceptance and is now an integral part of the language's revival [29]. It shows that digital platforms, when welcoming to minority scripts, can even be places where spelling conventions are created and standardized to suit contemporary needs.

In summary, autocorrect and keyboard features can support endangered languages by making typing easier and more accurate ‚Äì but only if the languages are included in the digital infrastructure. The ongoing challenge is to integrate all languages into our apps and devices. Until then, many speakers will continue finding clever workarounds, from disabling autocorrect to building their own keyboard apps, to keep their languages alive in cyberspace.

## Community Adaptations on Social Media and Messaging

Crucially, the preservation of endangered languages online is driven not just by platform features but by the communities who leverage those platforms. All over the world, speakers of minority languages have formed online hubs to use and celebrate their tongues - effectively carving out a digital space for languages that might have been excluded from mainstream media. These real-world examples demonstrate both the power and the pitfalls of social networking for linguistic diversity.

On messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, we see endangered languages thriving within group chats and private conversations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an Occitan language WhatsApp group in France became a lifeline for learners and speakers. As one observer noted, activity in Occitan group chats "positively skyrocketed" under lockdown - members who used to occasionally post in Occitan began exchanging messages daily [30]. They shared Occitan-language memes, jokes, tips, and even hosted "happy hour" video calls entirely in their language [31, 32]. This surge in informal usage built confidence and community; participants were practicing Occitan in a fun, low-pressure setting when other social outlets were closed [31, 32]. Such examples show how social media can normalize everyday use of a minority language, countering the dominance of national languages in public life. Similarly, in Friesland (Netherlands), teens have taken to texting each other in Frisian even though they aren't formally taught to write it - thereby keeping the language present in their daily friendships [33]. As Dr. Sytsema (an Oxford researcher and Frisian speaker) notes, social apps have given youth control to use their heritage language outside of school constraints [34]. This kind of grassroots usage is essential for a language's intergenerational transmission.

Public-facing social networks also host vibrant communities devoted to endangered languages. On Twitter (X) and Facebook, indigenous language advocates create pages, hashtags, and challenges to encourage participation. A 2024 analysis of Punjabi and Setswana social media activity found a "rich tapestry of participation, expression, and community development in the digital arena‚Äù, illustrating how users rallied around their languages online [35, 36]. In these cases, Facebook posts and tweets in Punjabi or Setswana act as channels for cultural preservation, helping speakers navigate issues of identity and modern life in their own tongue [37, 38]. Consistent posting in the language - from folk tale threads to daily greetings - reinforces that the language is alive and adaptable to contemporary content [39, 40]. The study concluded that platforms like Facebook and X ‚Äúhave the potential to rejuvenate and conserve Indigenous, minority and endangered languages", provided communities actively engage there [41]. At the same time, it cautioned that the internet's global nature also reinforces dominant languages like English and Chinese, meaning smaller languages must work hard to maintain a foothold online [42]. Both truths coexist: the web can either dilute local languages or amplify them, depending on how it's used.

We also see individuals becoming content creators and teachers for their endangered languages on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. In the absence of formal classes or funding, passionate speakers use short videos and stories to share vocabulary, phrases, and cultural knowledge. For example, young creators on TikTok have started teaching words in Cree, Lakota, Hawai'ian, and other languages, often through catchy skits or daily word challenges. A recent media report described how TikTok and Instagram are filling the gap left by dwindling government funding for indigenous language classes - through entertaining clips, they reach thousands of viewers and spark interest in learning these languages among the youth. One TikTok influencer begins her videos with a friendly ‚ÄúT√°nsi‚Äù (hello in Cree) and proceeds to teach a few everyday phrases, blending education with social media's informal style. These efforts turn language learning into a shareable, viral activity. The hashtag challenges (like a #EndangeredLanguageChallenge) invite users to post themselves speaking or singing in their ancestral language, creating a ripple of visibility across networks. Each video or post in an endangered language serves as advocacy: it tells other speakers "you're not alone," and it exposes non-speakers to the language, possibly recruiting new learners.

**Community case studies:** An exemplary success story is the Louisiana Creole Virtual Classroom on Facebook. Over ten years, a Facebook group of Louisiana Creole speakers and learners grew into a full-fledged online classroom and resource hub. Members mentor each other, share homemade learning materials, and converse in Creole daily. Remarkably, this online community developed its own standard writing system for Creole (since institutional support was lacking) ‚Äì and that orthography has now been widely adopted offline as well [29, 43]. The Facebook group effectively created new fluent speakers of a critically endangered language through peer-to-peer interaction, proving that social media can be a viable platform for language revitalization when formal support is absent [44, 45]. Another case is the Inuit community in Canada's Arctic: organizations like the Qikiqtani Inuit Association have run "word of the day" campaigns on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, posting an Inuktitut word in syllabics along with its pronunciation and an image illustration [46, 47]. These posts not only teach vocabulary but also instill pride by showcasing the language in a modern, scroll-friendly format. According to QIA, such social media efforts are integral to building pride among Inuit youth and counteracting the English-heavy media that surrounds them [48, 9]. The number of native Inuktitut speakers may be modest (tens of thousands), but each share or retweet of an Inuktitut word helps raise its profile and encourage daily use.

Of course, challenges persist. Not all online spaces are welcoming. Smaller language communities sometimes face harassment or ridicule on mainstream platforms (e.g., Welsh speakers having tweets joked about by outsiders who don't recognize the language [49]). This can discourage public use of the language. Content moderation algorithms might also struggle with minority languages, occasionally flagging innocent posts for review simply because the language is not understood by the system. Despite these issues, the overall trend is that endangered language communities are carving out their own niches on social networks and messaging apps. Whether through private group chats or public hashtags, they are adapting spelling, inventing new jargon, and finding novel ways to express traditional concepts online. These adaptations are driven by necessity (to suit the platform) but often end up enriching the language, adding new layers of meaning or modes of expression that did not exist before.

## Linguistic Evolution: Lasting Effects of Digital Communication

The big question is: do these digital adaptations have lasting effects on endangered languages, for better or worse? Increasing evidence suggests that they do. Languages evolve to fit their users' lives, and today that life includes the internet. We are witnessing new colloquial registers and even minor grammatical shifts emerging from online usage. For instance, abbreviations coined in text messages might find their way into spoken vernacular. In some Welsh online communities, English borrowings and slang have been so frequently used in tweets and forums that they've become an accepted part of casual Welsh (a phenomenon linguists call code-switching normalization). While purists might bristle, this flexibility can indicate a language that is alive and accommodating change. In the Louisiana Creole example, the orthography born on Facebook has undoubtedly altered the course of Creole's evolution, giving it a written form that it lacked in widespread practice before [29]. That change is a positive, long-term outcome directly spurred by digital communication.

There are also cognitive and educational effects on speakers. Young people who grow up texting and tweeting in their heritage language may develop different competencies than previous generations. They might be more adept at informal writing and using the language playfully, but perhaps less exposed to formal registers (if those aren't also present online). This is why some language advocates stress that digital use should complement traditional learning ‚Äì tweeting in Cherokee is fantastic for visibility, but ideally it goes hand-in-hand with learning to read longer texts or speak in formal contexts. On the flip side, digital media injects endangered languages into domains once reserved for global languages, like technology and pop culture discussions. This can lead to the creation of modern vocabulary in these languages. When a new gadget or meme appears, speakers coin terms for it in their own language on the fly. Some of these neologisms stick and become part of the lexicon, preventing the language from being seen as outdated or unable to describe the modern world. For example, the Icelandic language (though not endangered) famously coins new words for tech rather than borrowing English terms ‚Äì minority language communities online often do the same, suggesting native words for ‚Äúcomputer", "internet", etc., and seeing which term gains traction. Social media accelerates this process by crowdsourcing suggestions and rapidly popularizing the chosen words through shares.

From a preservation standpoint, having an online presence can dramatically increase a language's survival odds. As linguist Anna Luisa Daigneault explains, ‚ÄúEndangered languages stand a greater chance of survival when they are used online. Having a Web presence for those languages is super important for their survival" [50, 51]. Simply put, a language that adapts to Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube is more likely to be transmitted to the next generation because it's part of their daily environment. Contrast this with a language that lives only in grandparents' memories or academic books - it struggles to compete for attention. By embedding endangered languages into memes, videos, and chats, communities are making them cool, accessible, and relevant. This can also shift attitudes: younger members may feel more pride and ownership over their language when they see it trending in a hashtag or used by an influencer they admire. For example, the resurgence of the MƒÅori language in New Zealand has been helped by its presence in music, social media, and even user interfaces ‚Äì it's visible and audible in places where English used to dominate, changing perceptions from "language of the elders" to "language of my friends and modern culture."

That said, it's important to acknowledge the flip side: digital divide and exclusion. Not all speakers of endangered languages have equal access to technology. Older speakers might not be active on social media, so purely digital preservation could leave them behind. Furthermore, if a language's online use is confined to informal domains, it might not help in domains like education or government unless those are also addressed. The ideal scenario is a balanced approach: use social and digital platforms to strengthen the language, while also advocating for its use in schools, media, and official contexts (where platform idiosyncrasies like character limits won't constrain it). Dr. Sytsema reminds us that tweeting and texting, while helpful, are "not enough in the long-term" without broader support like education policy and media in the language [52, 53]. Digital efforts should be seen as part of a larger revitalization ecosystem.

## Conclusion

Digital platform features ‚Äì the length of a tweet, the smileys on our keyboards, the autocorrect algorithms under our fingers - all influence how endangered languages are used and evolve in the 21st century. These features can sometimes pose challenges: strict character limits encourage speakers to simplify or switch languages; generic emoji sets may not reflect a culture's unique concepts; and lack of proper keyboard/ predictive support can frustrate users into using dominant languages. Yet, as we've seen, these same features also offer unprecedented opportunities. They force communities to innovate new abbreviations and slang, inspire the creation of culturally relevant digital content (from emoji apps to hashtag campaigns), and provide platforms where speakers scattered by geography can unite in their mother tongue.

Social media and messaging platforms have become important new domains for endangered languages - domains where these languages can either thrive or fade. The difference lies in how we adapt technology to linguistic diversity, and how communities harness what's available. The experiences of Punjabi Twitter users, Setswana Facebook groups, Occitan WhatsApp chats, and Louisiana Creole Facebook classrooms all showcase an encouraging fact: when given even the smallest opening, people will use their language with enthusiasm online, "highlighting the potential of [digital] platforms to preserve and promote" their languages [35, 54]. Endangered languages can gain new learners and new forms of expression through digital use. A language that develops a chat slang and a social media presence is, by definition, continuing to live and change rather than ossify.

In the end, the preservation of endangered languages in the digital age will depend on a mix of human effort and tech design. Platform designers can do their part by expanding support (more languages in autocorrect dictionaries, more flexibility with scripts and input, more inclusive content policies), thereby reducing the hurdles for minority language users. Communities and advocates will continue to do their part by creating content, teaching each other, and normalizing their languages in every corner of the internet they can reach. The story is still unfolding, but one thing is clear: digital platforms are not making endangered languages disappear - people, especially youth, are actively using these tools to keep their languages alive, one tweet, text, and emoji at a time. With creativity and support, the very technologies that once seemed to threaten linguistic diversity could become the catalysts that help save it [55, 50].
