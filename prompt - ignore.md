I am working on a book project called 'The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas' which is being written by Claude under my supervision. Please read the book-outline-v[XX].md file I'm providing, which contains the complete project plan, timeline, and current status. After reading it:

1. Identify the current phase and what specific work needs to be done based on the 'Current Phase' and 'Next Immediate Action' sections
2. Tell me which specific files you need from the GitHub repository to complete that phase's work
3. Provide any Deep Research prompts I should run if you identify gaps while writing
4. Once I provide the requested files, complete the work for that phase, creating all outputs as artifacts
5. At the end of our conversation, provide an updated version of the book outline with:
   - Incremented version number (v20, v21, etc.)
   - Updated 'Current Phase'
   - Marked completion status for finished work
   - Clear 'Next Immediate Action' for the following conversation

My role is to provide requested files, run Deep Research prompts, and ensure we stay on schedule for June 2 completion. The book must maintain academic rigor while being accessible to general readers, following the style guidelines once established. Let's begin.
