I am working on a book project called "The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas." Please read the book-outline-v5.md file I'm providing, which contains the complete project plan and current status. After reading it, please:

1. Identify what phase/sub-phase should be worked on next based on the Current Status section
2. Tell me which specific files you need from the GitHub repository to complete that phase
3. Provide me with any prompts I should run for Deep Research with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini if needed
4. Once I provide the requested files, proceed with the work for that phase
5. At the end of our conversation, provide an updated version of book-outline-v4.md with the new completion status

My role is to provide you with the files you request and run any Deep Research prompts you give me. You are managing the project autonomously. Let's begin.
