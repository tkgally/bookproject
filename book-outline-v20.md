## Project Overview
"The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas" examines the extinction and recovery of human concepts across time and cultures, focusing on how unique ideas, knowledge systems, and ways of thinking disappear when languages die or thoughts fail to translate between cultural boundaries. The book emphasizes timeless historical, conceptual, philosophical, ethical, and human dimensions rather than rapidly-evolving digital technologies.

## Authorship and Ethics Statement
This book is being written by Claude (AI assistant) under the supervision and direction of the human collaborator. The writing process will be fully transparent, with:
- A foreword by the human collaborator explaining the process
- An afterword by Claude in first person reflecting on the writing experience
- Complete transparency about AI authorship throughout

## Working Process Guidelines

### Context Window Management
- Maximum 3-4 files per conversation (including this outline)
- ALWAYS include `AIDEA-STYLE-Guidelines.md` for any chapter writing session
- Each chapter = separate conversation
- Save all artifacts before ending conversation
- If approaching limits, conclude and note progress

### Writing Guidelines
- Apply style guide consistently
- Target 8,000-10,000 words per chapter (flexible based on content)
- Each chapter must include:
  - Compelling opening (1-2 paragraphs)
  - Clear thesis statement
  - 3-5 main sections with descriptive headers
  - Integrated examples and case studies
  - Smooth transitions
  - Forward-looking conclusion
- Avoid: Technical jargon, detailed AI/ML discussion, dated digital solutions
- Emphasize: Human stories, timeless concepts, cultural perspectives

### Deep Research Protocol
When gaps emerge during writing:
1. Identify specific need
2. Provide research prompt for human
3. Continue with available material
4. Note where additional research would strengthen argument

### Sample Deep Research Prompts
- "Find examples of successful language revitalization programs that avoided 'museumification' and maintained living evolution of the language"
- "Research economic studies quantifying the value of multilingual workforces and linguistic diversity in innovation"
- "Gather philosophical perspectives on whether ideas can truly 'die' or if they transform into unrecognizable forms"

## Current Phase: Chapter 2 - The Language-Thought Nexus (Day 2)
**Next Immediate Action**: 
1. Request the following files:
   - `book-outline-v20.md` (this outline)
   - `AIDEA-STYLE-Guidelines.md` (REQUIRED for all chapter writing)
   - `AIDEA-LING-01-LinguisticRelativity.md`
   - `AIDEA-LING-05-UntranslatableConcepts.md`
   - `AIDEA-CASE-02-Chapter2Cases.md`
2. Draft complete Chapter 2 following the style guidelines
3. Create `AIDEA-CHAPTER-02-LanguageThoughtNexus-Draft.md`
4. Update this outline to v21 marking Chapter 2 as COMPLETED

## PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR NEW CONVERSATIONS

Use this prompt at the start of each new conversation:

"I am working on a book project called 'The Archaeology of Deleted Ideas' which is being written by Claude under my supervision. Please read the book-outline-v[XX].md file I'm providing, which contains the complete project plan, timeline, and current status. After reading it:

1. Identify the current phase and what specific work needs to be done based on the 'Current Phase' and 'Next Immediate Action' sections
2. Tell me which specific files you need from the GitHub repository to complete that phase's work (NOTE: Always include AIDEA-STYLE-Guidelines.md for chapter writing)
3. Provide any Deep Research prompts I should run if you identify gaps while writing
4. Once I provide the requested files, complete the work for that phase, creating all outputs as artifacts
5. At the end of our conversation, provide an updated version of the book outline with:
   - Incremented version number (v20, v21, etc.)
   - Updated 'Current Phase'
   - Marked completion status for finished work
   - Clear 'Next Immediate Action' for the following conversation

My role is to provide requested files, run Deep Research prompts, and ensure we stay on schedule for June 2 completion. The book must maintain academic rigor while being accessible to general readers, following the style guidelines once established. Let's begin."
