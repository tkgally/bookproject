# **Weaving the World Anew: Indigenous Language Revitalization and the Preservation of Conceptual Frameworks**

## **I. Introduction: The Symbiotic Relationship Between Indigenous Languages and Conceptual Frameworks**

Indigenous languages are far more than mere instruments of communication; they are intricate, living systems intrinsically interwoven with unique conceptual frameworks, worldviews, epistemologies, and cultural identities.1 The worldview of Indigenous peoples is not separate from their language but is delicately woven into its very fabric and modes of expression.3 These languages serve as primary vessels for ancestral teachings, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), spirituality, and the entire "fabric of existence" for a community.4 Consequently, the erosion or loss of an Indigenous language signifies a profound and often irreparable loss of these sophisticated conceptual systems, which have been developed and refined over millennia.2 Native languages encode unique cultural concepts, and their linguistic features, such as verb-based structures or specific terminologies for kinship and the natural world, often reflect deeply held cultural values and understandings of reality.5 For instance, the Indigenous historical conceptual framework of some Pacific Northwest tribes draws upon the teachings of dendrochronology, framing time and ancestral understanding in a way that defies Western linear chronologies, emphasizing a connection "Since Time Immemorial".4

The vitality of an Indigenous language is thus inextricably linked to the vitality of its embedded conceptual frameworks. A language that exists only as a documented list of vocabulary and grammatical rules, detached from its cultural and conceptual moorings, cannot be considered truly "revitalized" in an Indigenous sense. True revitalization necessitates the active transmission and understanding of these underlying worldviews by new generations of speakers. This is because Indigenous worldviews are fundamentally contained within their languages.5 If revitalization efforts focus solely on lexical acquisition, they risk missing the core essence of what makes these languages unique and invaluable repositories of human knowledge and experience.1 The success stories in language revitalization, such as those of the Māori and Hawaiian peoples, consistently demonstrate a holistic approach that prioritizes the transmission of culture and worldview alongside linguistic skills.7

This report aims to explore contemporary Indigenous language revitalization programs that have demonstrated notable success in not only increasing the number of speakers but also in preserving and transmitting these profound conceptual frameworks. The focus is on initiatives that move beyond superficial linguistic acquisition to foster a holistic understanding and embodiment of Indigenous epistemologies. Such programs recognize that the goal is not merely individual fluency, but the comprehensive revitalization of both language and culture within the broader community, contributing to cultural continuity and overall well-being.7

The historical and ongoing suppression of Indigenous languages has been a deliberate colonial strategy, not just to impede communication, but to systematically sever the conceptual ties that bind Indigenous peoples to their identity, land, spirituality, and ancestral knowledge.11 Policies such as the forced attendance at boarding schools, where children were physically punished for speaking their native tongues, were designed to assimilate Indigenous youth into the dominant culture by erasing their unique ways of knowing and being.7 This created a profound "conceptual rupture," inflicting intergenerational trauma that continues to affect communities today.11 Therefore, language revitalization efforts that consciously work to restore and transmit these conceptual frameworks are not merely educational endeavors; they are profound acts of healing, decolonization, and cultural reaffirmation.18 By re-centering Indigenous epistemologies, these programs address the deepest wounds of colonization, fostering a renewed sense of identity, purpose, and connection for Indigenous peoples.7

## **II. Defining Success: Moving Beyond Lexicon to Worldview in Language Revitalization**

In the context of Indigenous language revitalization, success transcends the mere acquisition of vocabulary and grammatical structures. True, sustainable revitalization involves the transmission and embodiment of the conceptual frameworks that give a language its unique meaning, depth, and cultural resonance. These frameworks are often holistic, emphasizing relationality, cyclical understandings of time, a profound connection to land and place, and the seamless integration of spirituality into all aspects of life.5

Indigenous conceptual frameworks are not abstract philosophical constructs but are lived realities, expressed, reinforced, and perpetuated through the language itself. For example, many Indigenous languages are verb-based, a characteristic that intrinsically reflects an ontology centered on processes, actions, relationships, and transformations, rather than static objects or entities which are often prioritized in noun-based languages like English.5 The polysynthetic nature of languages such as Anishinaabemowin, where complex ideas can be conveyed in a single, multi-morphemic word, further illustrates how linguistic structure encodes a particular way of perceiving and organizing the world.5 Similarly, Indigenous languages often possess rich and nuanced vocabularies for specific local ecosystems, kinship structures, and spiritual concepts that have no direct equivalents in dominant languages, highlighting the deep connection between language, environment, and social organization.1 An "Indigenous Historical Conceptual Framework," as described for some Pacific Northwest tribes, is rooted in the natural world (dendrochronology) and "Ancestral Teachings," offering a perspective on time and history that is fundamentally different from Western linear models.4 These frameworks emphasize the interconnectedness of all life, where stories and oral traditions weave together the entire "fabric of existence".6

Approaches to language revitalization that focus predominantly on lexicon and grammar, without a corresponding emphasis on these underlying conceptual frameworks, risk creating a "hollow" or superficial version of the language. Such efforts may produce speakers who can construct grammatically correct sentences but lack the deep cultural understanding necessary to use the language in conceptually authentic ways, or to fully grasp the wisdom, values, and perspectives embedded within it.8 Individual fluency, if detached from broader cultural revitalization and the re-establishment of Indigenous ways of knowing, may not achieve the ultimate goals of community healing and cultural continuity.11 The danger lies in fostering a generation of speakers who are linguistically competent but conceptually disconnected from the heritage their language is meant to carry. This underscores the critical importance of programs that explicitly integrate "Indigenous epistemologies" and recognize language as a "cultural cornerstone".7

The principle of linguistic relativity, which posits that the structure of a language affects its speakers' worldview or cognition 1, is not merely a theoretical abstraction but a practical reality vividly demonstrated in successful Indigenous language revitalization. Programs that understand this dynamic actively leverage the unique structures of Indigenous languages as pedagogical tools for transmitting worldview. For instance, by immersing learners in a verb-centric language like Anishinaabemowin, educators are not just teaching words for actions, but are cultivating a way of thinking that prioritizes relationships, processes, and animacy, which are central to the Anishinaabe worldview.5 This is a profound shift from simply learning *words for* concepts to learning to *think within* the conceptual patterns intrinsically encoded by the language.

Furthermore, a deep understanding of these conceptual frameworks is a prerequisite for what can be termed "deep" language use. True fluency extends beyond conversational ability to encompass the capacity to use the language creatively, appropriately, and effectively in a wide range of culturally significant contexts, such as ceremonies, traditional governance, complex storytelling, and the transmission of sacred knowledge.3 Creation stories, for example, are often considered sacred and are traditionally conveyed through specific oral traditions, implying that a nuanced conceptual understanding is necessary for respectful and meaningful engagement.3 Similarly, participation in ceremonial and spiritual practices often depends on the precise and conceptually informed use of the language.7 Programs that teach language in conjunction with cultural practices, such as the Anishinaabemowin programs that integrate the use of ceremonial objects like shakers, recognize that full participation in cultural life requires more than vocabulary; it demands the conceptual map that the language and its embedded worldview provide.22 The aim, therefore, is not just linguistic competence, but cultural competence and profound conceptual understanding.

## **III. Case Studies: Exemplars in Preserving Indigenous Conceptual Frameworks**

The following case studies illustrate diverse and successful approaches to embedding Indigenous conceptual frameworks within language revitalization programs. These examples, drawn from various Indigenous communities worldwide, highlight the innovative strategies employed to ensure that language learning is deeply connected to cultural identity, traditional knowledge, and unique ways of understanding the world. A comparative overview is presented in Table 1\.

### **A. The Māori Model: Te Kōhanga Reo, Kura Kaupapa Māori, and the Te Whāriki Curriculum**

The Māori language revitalization movement in Aotearoa (New Zealand) is globally recognized for its innovative and comprehensive approach. Central to this success are *Te Kōhanga Reo* ("language nests"), an early childhood education initiative established in 1982 where preschool children are immersed entirely in *te reo Māori* (the Māori language) and culture.7 These community-driven centers emphasize the collaborative efforts of *whānau* (extended family) in providing language instruction and care, with Māori being the sole language permitted in the presence of children.9 Following the success of *Te Kōhanga Reo*, *Kura Kaupapa Māori* (Māori-medium primary and secondary schools) were developed from 1985 to provide a continuous pathway for Māori language education, subordinating the entire educational system to Māori aspirations and needs.9

The guiding philosophy underpinning these initiatives is *Kaupapa Māori*, a Māori-centered approach that validates and legitimizes Māori knowledge, language, culture, and worldview as the foundation for educational theory and practice.25 *Kaupapa Māori* research and practice aim for positive, transformational outcomes for Māori people, empowering communities to define and control their own educational destinies.29 This philosophy is operationalized in early childhood settings through *Te Whāriki*, Aotearoa's national early childhood curriculum framework. Significantly, *Te Whāriki a te Kōhanga Reo* is a distinct curriculum document written in *te reo Māori* specifically for *kōhanga reo*, rather than being a mere translation of the English version.17 It is deeply rooted in Māori conceptual frameworks, incorporating four fundamental dimensions of human development: *taha tinana* (physical well-being), *taha hinengaro* (mental and intellectual well-being), *taha wairua* (spiritual well-being), and *taha whatumanawa* (emotional well-being).17 These dimensions are also reflected in holistic Māori models of health such as Tā Mason Durie’s *Te Whare Tapa Whā* (the four-sided house).17 The very term "*whāriki*" signifies a woven mat, a *taonga* (treasure) that metaphorically represents the developing child and the interwoven nature of the curriculum's principles, influences from family and community, and the collaborative efforts of all involved in a child’s learning.17 Key principles of *Te Whāriki* include *Whakamana* (Empowerment), *Kotahitanga* (Holistic Development), *Whānau Tangata* (Family and Community), and *Ngā Hononga* (Relationships), all of which guide practice towards affirming Māori culture, knowledge, and community connections.17 Pre-colonial Māori views on "languaculture" emphasized concepts such as *tapu* (sacred protection) and *noa* (everyday status), and the vital importance of *mana* (prestige, spiritual power) and *mauri* (life principle), all of which inform the cultural underpinnings of these educational approaches.46

Pedagogical approaches within *Te Kōhanga Reo* and *Kura Kaupapa Māori* are designed to transmit these conceptual frameworks effectively. Total immersion in *te reo Māori* is paramount, creating an environment where children naturally acquire the language and its embedded cultural nuances.9 *Whānau* involvement is not peripheral but central, with families and *kaiako* (teachers/educators) operating as a unified support system for the *mokopuna* (grandchildren/children).25 This fosters strong intergenerational transmission of language and culture.29 Traditional Māori practices of knowledge transmission, known as *kōrero tuku iho* (knowledge handed down orally through generations), are integral. This includes the use of storytelling, *pakiwaitara* (legends and myths), *whakairo* (carvings), and *tukutuku* (ornamental latticework) as tools for both learning and assessment.25 Assessment itself is culturally embedded; for example, the *Ngā Kōrero Tuku Iho* (NKTI) approach developed by Te Kōhanga Reo ki Rotokawa uses these traditional forms to represent a child's progress in a culturally resonant manner, moving away from solely Western-centric assessment models.26 The focus is always on the holistic development of the child, encompassing their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional dimensions.25

Reported outcomes indicate significant success in preserving and transmitting Māori conceptual frameworks. Students in Māori-medium education demonstrate positive attitudes towards learning their heritage language, largely due to the strong connection forged between language, culture, and identity.28 The NKTI assessment approach, for instance, helps children understand the importance of their *whakapapa* (genealogy) and the central role of *whānau*, thereby affirming their Māori worldview and sense of belonging.26 These programs have been instrumental in reigniting and reinforcing cultural connections and identity, contributing to a broader cultural renaissance.29 The ZePA (Zero-Passive-Active) model, developed to understand Māori language revitalization, highlights how the societal valuing of the language acts as a catalyst for Indigenous existence and facilitates the transmission of Indigenous knowledge within both Māori and mainstream contexts.27 These outcomes clearly demonstrate that the Māori model achieves far more than vocabulary acquisition; it fosters a deep and embodied understanding of Māori identity, cultural concepts, and epistemology.

### **B. The Hawaiian Model: Pūnana Leo, Kula Kaiapuni, and the Kumu Honua Mauli Ola Philosophy**

The revitalization of *ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi* (the Hawaiian language) represents another landmark success story, characterized by a comprehensive, community-driven approach that places Hawaiian worldview at its core. Inspired in part by the Māori *Kōhanga Reo* movement, *Pūnana Leo* ("nest of voices") preschools were established in the early 1980s, offering full immersion in Hawaiian language and culture.7 These preschools create an environment where children are "fed" their native language and culture, much like young birds in a nest.33 The success of *Pūnana Leo* paved the way for *Kula Kaiapuni*, a K-12 public school Hawaiian language immersion pathway, ensuring continuity of education in Hawaiian from early childhood through to university and even doctoral studies.31

The philosophical foundation of this movement is the *Kumu Honua Mauli Ola* (KHMO), a Hawaiian philosophy of education developed by Hawaiian-speaking educators to articulate the basis of schooling through the Hawaiian language.10 The KHMO emphasizes a profound connection and responsibility to the environment (*aloha ʻāina* – love of the land), to one another (community and relationships), and to the cultivation of self-identity and life-force through spirituality, language, cultural mannerisms (*lawena*), and traditional knowledge (*ʻike kuʻuna*).10 Central to the KHMO is the concept of *mauli Hawaiʻi*, the unique Hawaiian life force or spirit that is nurtured and expressed by those who identify as Hawaiian.10 This *mauli* is sustained by four interconnected elements: *Ka ʻAoʻao Pili ʻUhane* (the spiritual element), *Ka ʻAoʻao ʻŌlelo* (the language element), *Ka ʻAoʻao Lawena* (the physical behavior/mannerism element), and *Ka ʻAoʻao ʻIke Kuʻuna* (the traditional knowledge element).10 The Hawaiian revitalization model is thus fundamentally a cultural reconceptualization model; it aims to reformulate and strengthen Hawaiian identity, with language serving as both an iconic symbol and a practical vehicle for this transformation.10 It consciously focuses on remodeling cultural identity, recognizing that language shift is often a secondary symptom of deeper socio-cultural changes, and that the entire "ecology within which language is embedded must change" for revitalization to be successful.10

The pedagogical approaches employed in *Pūnana Leo* and *Kula Kaiapuni* are direct expressions of the KHMO philosophy. Total immersion in *ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi* from the earliest age is a cornerstone, allowing children to acquire the language naturally within a rich cultural context.10 The curriculum is entirely culturally based, grounded in Hawaiian values and traditions such as the importance of place (*Aloha ʻĀina*), reciprocal relationships with the environment, family and community bonds, and principles of responsibility and stewardship.10 Learning is deeply connected to living Hawaiian cultural practices, including *hula* (dance), *mele* (chant/song), traditional fishing methods, *kalo* (taro) farming, canoe building, and voyaging.10 Parental and family involvement is actively encouraged and often required, reinforcing language use in the home and strengthening community ties.10 A key strategy is the creation of *honua* – dedicated environments such as schools, offices, personal relationships, and homes where only Hawaiian is spoken and the *mauli Hawaiʻi* is actively fostered and nurtured.32

The outcomes of the Hawaiian language revitalization movement provide compelling evidence of its success in transmitting conceptual frameworks and cultural values. Children emerging from these programs develop not only fluency in *ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi* but also a strong sense of Hawaiian cultural identity, feeling deeply connected to their heritage through the language.31 *Pūnana Leo* and *Kula Kaiapuni* foster an appreciation for Hawaiian culture that extends far beyond mere language acquisition, instilling traditional values and ways of knowing.31 Parents consistently report that their children become "secure in their identity, respectful, and caring about their community" as a direct result of the foundational learning in Hawaiian language, culture, and values.30 The movement has successfully nurtured a new generation of speakers who are able to "describe the world through the lens of their language and culture," effectively seeing and interpreting their experiences through a Hawaiian conceptual framework.33 Furthermore, accreditation bodies like the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium (WINHEC) have acknowledged the cognitive advantages of this approach, noting that children in *Pūnana Leo* often outperform their English-speaking peers in early literacy skills.34 This success is attributed to the holistic, worldview-centered approach that actively works to rebuild and reaffirm cultural identity, creating vibrant domains where the language and its conceptual underpinnings can thrive.

### **C. Anishinaabemowin Revitalization: Weaving Language with Anishinaabe Epistemologies**

Revitalization efforts for Anishinaabemowin (also known as Ojibwe, Ojibway, or Chippewa), a language spoken by Anishinaabe peoples across a vast territory in North America, are deeply committed to restoring the language as a vital link to Anishinaabe history, identity, spirituality, and traditional territories. These initiatives recognize that Anishinaabemowin preserves unique ways of seeing, knowing, and relating to the world, and its revitalization is crucial for cultural continuity and healing.18 The verb-based, polysynthetic nature of Anishinaabemowin, where single words can convey complex meanings equivalent to entire English sentences, intrinsically reflects an interconnected and animate worldview, a key aspect that revitalization programs aim to transmit.5

The guiding philosophies for many Anishinaabemowin revitalization programs are rooted in *Anishinaabe Gikendaasowinan* ("The People's Way of Knowing") and *Mino-Bimaadiziwin* ("Living the Good Life" or "the good path"). Institutions like Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College (FDLTCC) offer programs accredited by the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium (WINHEC) that explicitly aim to honor and extend traditional Anishinaabe knowledge, with the language understood as being at the very heart of the Anishinaabe worldview.23 FDLTCC's Anishinaabeg Gikendaasowinan programs are structured around seven core cultural standards or learning goals: *Gikendaasowin* (Knowing knowledge), *Gwayakwaadiziwin* (Living a balanced way), *Zoongide'ewin* (Strong hearted), *Aangwaamiziwin* (Diligence and caution), *Debwewin* (Honesty and integrity), *Zaagi'idiwin* (Loving and Caring), and *Zhawenindiwin* (Compassion).23 These standards are not viewed as separate competencies but as highly interdependent principles reflecting a holistic Anishinaabe worldview. *Mino-Bimaadiziwin*, as a philosophical concept, emphasizes that learning Anishinaabemowin is integral to developing a firm Anishinaabe identity, as language and identity are inextricably intertwined.35 This philosophy also highlights the importance of understanding one's purpose, maintaining a connection to the spirit, engaging in lifelong learning derived from the natural world, and prioritizing the community and creation before the self.35 Some revitalization efforts explicitly map their work onto the Anishinaabe Medicine Wheel, understanding language learning as having interconnected mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical impacts. This approach often involves weaving in the Seven Grandfather Teachings (Love, Respect, Honesty, Truth, Wisdom, Humility, and Bravery) as acts of resistance to colonial assimilation and as pathways to healing from historical and cultural genocide.18 The overarching goal is a return to "our own words, our own meanings, our own definitions of ourselves, and our own world".22

Pedagogical approaches in Anishinaabemowin revitalization are diverse and designed to immerse learners in the language and its conceptual frameworks. Immersion programs, including language camps, are increasingly popular.22 Some camps explicitly teach the language alongside traditional ceremonies, recognizing the deep connection between linguistic practice and spiritual understanding.22 A key strategy involves teaching the language through culturally significant objects, such as the use of *zhiishiigwanag* (shakers) in ceremonial contexts, thereby simultaneously teaching linguistic forms and reinforcing Anishinaabe identity.22 The restoration of the traditional role of Elders as primary caregivers, knowledge keepers, and teachers is also emphasized as crucial for authentic intergenerational transmission.14 Land-based learning is fundamental, with courses focusing on pre-contact Indigenous land sustainability practices, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), and Anishinaabe lifeways as they relate to the thirteen-moon cycle and the natural environment.36 Storytelling and oral traditions, including Anishinaabe Creation Stories, serve as vital tools for transmitting worldview, history, and values.36 Learning is often infused with ceremony and practices that foster a connection to the spirit, such as fasting and learning directly from the natural world.35 Some programs also adopt a "Two-Eyed Seeing" approach, which seeks to bridge Indigenous research methodologies and ways of knowing with Western perspectives in a respectful and complementary manner.18

The reported outcomes of these Anishinaabemowin revitalization efforts underscore their success in preserving conceptual frameworks. Language revitalization is explicitly viewed as a process of healing from intergenerational trauma and as a means of reclaiming and recentering the Anishinaabe worldview.18 Students engaged in these programs develop a deeper understanding of Anishinaabe lifeways, the concept of an interactive and interconnected universe, and the importance of living in balance.36 A primary objective is to cultivate speakers who can use Anishinaabemowin and Anishinaabe knowledge effectively to speak, listen, and act in culturally appropriate and meaningful ways.23 Learning the language is consistently linked to the development of a stronger Anishinaabe identity and a clearer understanding of one's purpose within the community and creation.35 These programs are actively working to decolonize education by centering Anishinaabe epistemology. The focus extends beyond linguistic proficiency to what some term "Becoming Indigenous" 18 – a transformative process of fostering a deep, embodied understanding of the Anishinaabe worldview, its values, and its spiritual connections.

### **D. Navajo (Diné) Revitalization: Education Through Sa'ah Naagháíí Bik'eh Hózhóón**

The Navajo (Diné) Nation has undertaken significant efforts to revitalize *Diné Bizaad* (the Navajo language), which, despite being the most widely spoken Native American language in the United States, still faces pressures that threaten its long-term vitality.7 These revitalization initiatives often involve immersion schools and culturally grounded educational philosophies designed to transmit the profound conceptual frameworks embedded in the Diné language and worldview.

A central guiding philosophy in many Diné educational contexts is *Sa'ah Naagháíí Bik'eh Hózhóón* (SNBH). This foundational concept represents the Diné traditional living system, an epistemology that places Diné life in harmonious balance with the natural world and the universe.19 SNBH is a complex system of knowledge, with *Hózhó* – encompassing concepts of harmony, beauty, balance, health, and order – at its very core.19 The principles of SNBH are often expressed through teachings associated with the four sacred cardinal directions: *Nitsáhákees* (Thinking/Conceptualizing – East), *Nahatʼá* (Planning/Designing – South), *Iiná* (Living/Implementing – West), and *Siihasin* (Reflection/Assurance – North).38 This cyclical philosophy guides individuals and the community towards a life of well-being and purpose. Within this framework, the preservation of the Diné language is intrinsically linked to the preservation of Diné culture and identity; one cannot be fully maintained without the other.40 The Diné philosophy of *Hózhó* serves as a practical guide for thoughts, actions, behaviors, and speech, emphasizing intentional living and positive relationships.19 Educational institutions like Diné College explicitly adopt SNBH as the framework for all educational planning and activities, including language programs.38 Similarly, immersion schools such as Tséhootsooí Diné Bi'ólta' (TDB) base their approach on Diné philosophy, aligning it with the processes of Western schooling to prepare students for a multicultural society while upholding Diné values.41

The pedagogical approaches used in Diné language revitalization are designed to implement the SNBH philosophy and transmit its conceptual underpinnings. Immersion schools like TDB employ models such as 90-10 (90% Diné language instruction, 10% English in early grades), ensuring maximum exposure to *Diné Bizaad* in all school environments.41 This creates a Diné language and cultural rich environment that extends beyond the classroom to the lunchroom, playground, hallways, and even the school bus, fostering naturalistic language acquisition.41 Curricula are culturally responsive, emphasizing Diné language, culture, history, and values.40 For example, the Native American Community Academy (NACA) offers Navajo language and Diné Government classes and connects subjects like English/Language Arts to Indigenous cultures and literature.40 A specific pedagogical technique, "Situational Navajo," involves creating real-life scenarios that concentrate on the use of Diné verbs, reflecting the language's structure and promoting practical communication skills. This approach is often grounded in the Diné *kʼé* (clan and kinship relationship) system, reinforcing social and cultural connections.41 Experiential learning through academic activities, field trips, and out-of-school programs further enriches the educational experience.40 A significant emphasis is placed on oral language development, particularly before puberty, a strategy that aligns with both Diné cultural practices (such as the *Kinaaldá* puberty ceremony, which marks a transition for body and mind) and research on optimal periods for language acquisition.41

The outcomes of these SNBH-grounded revitalization efforts point towards success in transmitting Diné conceptual frameworks. Students in immersion programs gain proficiency not only in speaking, reading, and writing *Diné Bizaad* but also in thinking in ways that reflect Diné epistemology.41 The \+Language is Medicine (+LiM) study, a community-based initiative on the Navajo Nation, exemplifies this by redefining "language nutrition" to align with Indigenous values that center cultural connectedness and native language use, moving beyond purely linguistic metrics.19 Diné College, guided by SNBH, aims to prepare students for further education and employment while fostering social responsibility, community service, and scholarly research that contribute to the overall social, economic, and cultural well-being of the Navajo Nation.38 Similarly, the mission of TDB is to enable students to become successful in a multicultural society while carrying forward Diné values of lifelong learning and cultural understanding.41 These programs strive to instill not just language skills but a way of living in *Hózhó* – harmony and balance – reflecting the core tenets of the Diné worldview and contributing to the resilience and strength of the Diné people.

### **E. Sámi Language Nests: Fostering Cultural Continuity and Worldview**

The Sámi people, Indigenous to Sápmi, a region spanning northern parts of Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Russia, speak several distinct Sámi languages, many of which are endangered.42 Revitalization efforts across Sápmi have employed various strategies, with Sámi language nests, known as *giellabeassi* in North Sámi, emerging as a particularly effective model for intergenerational language transmission and cultural continuity.43 While the provided materials do not always articulate a single, overarching named philosophical doctrine equivalent to *Kumu Honua Mauli Ola* or *Sa'ah Naagháíí Bik'eh Hózhóón* that universally guides all Sámi revitalization, the underlying principles are clearly rooted in countering the historical impacts of assimilationist policies, strengthening Sámi identity, and ensuring the transmission of traditional knowledge, cultural practices, and Sámi ways of understanding the world.42 For instance, the "Language and Culture Village Project" in Finland explicitly aimed to transfer Sámi language and traditions by basing activities on local Sámi cultural features and values.43

The success of Sámi revitalization efforts, particularly in fostering a holistic cultural understanding, is evident in the outcomes reported. The revitalization of Aanaar Sámi, one of the most critically endangered Sámi languages, is a notable success story that began with the establishment of language nests.43 These programs are reported to positively influence the entire Sámi language community, helping to overcome the negative experiences and trauma of previous generations subjected to harsh assimilation policies.43 A significant indicator of the transmission of conceptual frameworks is the observation that the revitalization of Sámi languages often leads to the revival of other aspects of traditional knowledge and culture, such as traditional livelihoods, ecological understanding, and oral traditions.43 Furthermore, these efforts frequently stimulate the production of new Sámi culture, including contemporary music, literature, and arts, demonstrating that the language and its associated worldview are not static relics but living, evolving systems.43 The "Language and Culture Village Project," for example, resulted in improved Sámi language skills among children and successfully transferred traditional knowledge and practices.43

Pedagogical approaches in Sámi revitalization are multifaceted and context-specific. Language nests (*giellabeassi*), inspired by the Māori *Te Kōhanga Reo* model, create immersive environments where young children acquire Sámi languages naturally from fluent speakers, often Elders.43 Master-Apprentice programs have also been successfully adapted, pairing learners with elderly mother-tongue "language masters" for intensive interaction that facilitates the acquisition of not only advanced speaking skills but also deep cultural knowledge and traditional ways of thinking.43 Sámi Language Centers play a crucial role by organizing language courses and cultural events, initiating revitalization projects for both language and traditions, collecting local linguistic knowledge such as place names (which are rich repositories of ecological and historical understanding), and actively creating new domains for Sámi language use in contemporary society.43 Socially sensitive and culture-based models, like the aforementioned "Language and Culture Village Project," integrate practical language learning with hands-on cultural activities such as traditional cooking, handicrafts, storytelling, singing, and play, all grounded in local Sámi cultural features.43 Additionally, innovative methods have been developed to address the mental and social barriers to language use that can arise from historical oppression, using cognitive theory-based approaches to help individuals overcome negative thoughts and beliefs associated with speaking their heritage language.43

Collectively, these approaches demonstrate a commitment to revitalizing Sámi languages as integral components of Sámi worldview and cultural identity. By creating immersive environments, fostering intergenerational connections, embedding language learning in cultural practices, and addressing the psychological legacies of colonialism, Sámi revitalization programs are working to ensure that the languages, and the unique conceptual frameworks they carry, continue to thrive for future generations. While the term "conceptual framework" may not be employed as a singular Sámi term in the snippets, the reported outcomes clearly point to a successful and holistic transmission of cultural worldview alongside linguistic skills.

### **F. Pertame Language Nest: Grassroots Immersion and Reconnecting to Cultural Foundations**

The Pertame language, from the country south of Mparntwe (Alice Springs) in Central Australia, is a severely endangered language with fewer than 30 fluent Elder speakers remaining.17 In response to this critical situation, the Pertame community has established the *Pertame Ngketja Untja* (Pertame Language Nest), a grassroots immersion playgroup designed for Pertame infants and their parents.17 This initiative is a profound effort to create new first-language speakers and reconnect younger generations with the deep cultural foundations embedded within the Pertame language.

The guiding philosophy of the Pertame Language Nest is to raise children as first-language Pertame speakers, mirroring the way the last generation of fluent Elders were raised – immersed in their language, family, and culture on their traditional homelands before the disruptions of colonization and English-only schooling.17 The program explicitly aligns with Indigenous traditional methods of intergenerational transmission, where knowledge, values, and worldview are passed down orally from Elders to adults and then to children.17 A core aim is to create a unique space where Pertame is the dominant language, effectively bringing it to equal status with English within the Nest environment and providing a vital sanctuary from the pervasive influence of English in children's daily lives.17 The Nest is envisioned as a place that honors every aspect of the children's culture, language, heritage, and community, thereby profoundly respecting and nurturing their Pertame worldview.17 The overarching goal is to cultivate "bilingual, culturally resilient, and community-connected children".17

The pedagogical approaches employed at the Pertame Language Nest are centered on total immersion and culturally rich, play-based learning. Within the Nest, no English is used; all communication is conducted in Pertame, with educators and Elders using non-verbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, actions, and pictures to aid understanding when needed.17 Intergenerational learning is a cornerstone, with children engaging in meaningful interaction with fluent Pertame Elders and educators. Significantly, multiple generations of a child's carers, including parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, often participate, creating a strong family-centered learning environment.17 Daily routines are infused with Pertame language and culture, including the recitation of a Pertame identity chant, nature walks and talks led by Elders, Pertame meditation and yoga, traditional songs, dances, nursery rhymes, art and craft activities, and story time featuring both books and role-play.17 The curriculum is structured around fortnightly themes directly related to elements of Pertame culture, such as feelings, traditional plant foods, the sky, parts of the body, family relationships, time, country (land and specific places), birds, bush meat, and water.17 These themes are integrated into all activities, ensuring that language learning is always contextualized within the Pertame conceptual framework. Family involvement is critical, with parents and carers encouraged to learn Pertame alongside their children and to continue speaking the language in their homes, thus extending the immersion environment beyond the Nest itself.44 The program prioritizes holistic development, focusing on building children's pride in their cultural identity, self-esteem, a sense of security within their Pertame community, overall wellbeing, and healthy physical routines, all narrated and reinforced in the Pertame language.17

While the Pertame Language Nest is a relatively recent initiative, its design and early focus strongly indicate a commitment to transmitting Pertame conceptual frameworks. The program aims to "lay strong foundations for Pertame children to develop pride and confidence in their cultural identity, self-esteem, and a sense of security within their Pertame community," which are crucial for their overall wellbeing later in life.17 The Nest explicitly states its capacity to "honour every aspect of our children's culture, language, heritage and community... We are able to respect the worldview of these children in a way that no other early-childhood program could achieve".17 Although specific long-term outcome data for the Pertame Nest is still emerging, the program draws on broader evidence, such as the findings of the 2020 National Indigenous Language Survey (NILS) in Australia, which found that learning an Indigenous language increased students' confidence, engagement in school, community pride in their culture, social connectedness, and social skills.17 By creating a total immersion environment deeply rooted in cultural activities, traditional knowledge themes, and strong intergenerational and family connections, the Pertame Language Nest is meticulously designed to transmit the Pertame worldview alongside the language, nurturing not just linguistic competence but the development of culturally grounded, confident young Pertame individuals.

Across these diverse case studies, a common thread emerges: the most impactful language revitalization programs operate as intensive "incubators" for both language and worldview. Language nests and full immersion schools, in particular, create protected linguistic and conceptual spaces where the Indigenous worldview can be the dominant lens through which young learners experience and make sense of the world, shielded from the overwhelming influence of dominant languages and cultures.7 This deliberate cultivation of a distinct conceptual environment is a critical strategy to counteract historical and ongoing assimilationist pressures.11 This intensive, protected immersion allows the Indigenous worldview, with all its nuances and values, to be deeply internalized from a very young age, laying a foundation for lifelong cultural connection.

Furthermore, programs that are guided by clearly articulated and deeply rooted Indigenous philosophies—such as the Hawaiian *Kumu Honua Mauli Ola*, the Māori *Te Whāriki* informed by *Kaupapa Māori*, the Diné *Sa'ah Naagháíí Bik'eh Hózhóón*, or the Anishinaabe *Gikendaasowinan* and *Mino-Bimaadiziwin*—appear to possess a more robust and intentional framework for transmitting conceptual depth.10 These philosophies are not merely supplementary components; they serve as the foundational blueprint for curriculum design, pedagogical practices, assessment methods, and even community engagement strategies. They define what knowledge is valued, how learning is understood to occur within that specific cultural context, and the desired outcomes for learners as culturally grounded, whole individuals. This philosophical grounding provides the essential "why" and "how" for embedding conceptual frameworks authentically and effectively into the revitalization process.

Ultimately, the most successful and transformative programs are engaged in more than just language teaching; they are active participants in a broader process of cultural reconceptualization and identity affirmation for the entire community.10 The language becomes a powerful vehicle for this wider cultural and social renewal. This suggests a reciprocal dynamic: a strong, affirmed cultural identity supports language revitalization, and a vibrant language, rich with its embedded conceptual frameworks, in turn strengthens and enriches that identity. It is a process of communities redefining themselves on their own terms, drawing strength from their linguistic and conceptual heritage to navigate the contemporary world with purpose and resilience.

## **IV. Foundational Pedagogies for Transmitting Conceptual Frameworks**

Across the successful language revitalization programs that prioritize the preservation of conceptual frameworks, several common and highly effective pedagogical strategies can be identified. These approaches move beyond rote memorization of vocabulary and grammar, instead fostering deep, contextualized learning that allows individuals to internalize and embody the worldview embedded within their ancestral language.

### **A. The Power of Immersion and Language Nests**

Creating environments where the Indigenous language is the sole or primary medium of communication, especially from a very early age, is a cornerstone of successful conceptual transmission.7 Language nests, such as the Māori *Te Kōhanga Reo*, Hawaiian *Pūnana Leo*, Pertame *Ngketja Untja*, and Sámi *giellabeassi*, as well as broader immersion schooling, provide a setting for naturalistic language acquisition that is deeply embedded in cultural context and daily activities.7 In these settings, as exemplified by the Pertame Nest's principle of "no English is used whatsoever" 17, learners are compelled to understand and express all concepts, from simple needs to complex ideas, through the Indigenous language. This constant engagement forces an internalization of the language's unique grammatical structures and, consequently, its associated worldview. For instance, the verb-centric nature of languages like Anishinaabemowin, which emphasizes actions, processes, and relationships over static objects 5, becomes a lived cognitive experience in an immersion setting. Children learn to perceive and describe the world through this relational lens, not as an abstract grammatical rule, but as the natural way of speaking and thinking.

### **B. The Centrality of Elders, Oral Traditions, and Storytelling**

The involvement of Elders as primary knowledge keepers, fluent speakers, and language models is consistently highlighted as vital for authentic revitalization.7 Elders embody the language in its richest cultural and conceptual depth. Storytelling, a core component of Indigenous oral traditions, serves as a powerful pedagogical tool to transmit history, values, beliefs, moral lessons, creation narratives, and intricate conceptual frameworks that define a community's understanding of the world and their place within it.3 Programs like the Pertame Language Nest incorporate "Nature walk and talk by Elders" and regular "Story time through books or role play" 17, while Anishinaabe programs often utilize Creation Stories as foundational texts for understanding worldview.36 Stories are not mere entertainment; they are rich repositories of cultural epistemology.3 For example, the widespread Turtle Island creation story found among many Indigenous nations in North America conveys fundamental concepts about the interconnectedness of all beings, the process of creation from water and earth, and the cooperative roles of animals and spiritual beings – all of which are central to those respective worldviews.6 Oral traditions inherently model the linguistic nuances, prosody, metaphorical language, and conceptual understandings that are often lost or diluted in written translations or purely academic linguistic study.

### **C. Land-Based Learning and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**

A profound and often inseparable connection exists between Indigenous languages and the specific lands and territories from which they arose.5 Many successful revitalization programs recognize this by incorporating land-based learning and the transmission of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) as integral to language acquisition. The Anishinaabeg Gikendaasowinan programs, for instance, explicitly emphasize understanding the interrelatedness of human society and the natural environment, and living in harmony with creation.23 Courses may teach pre-contact Indigenous land sustainability practices and TEK, often structured around traditional ecological calendars like the thirteen-moon cycle.36 The TEK-nology project, focusing on Anishinaabemowin, aims to center Indigenous worldviews in the use of technology for language learning, particularly as it relates to place-based knowledge and environmental responsiveness.21 Learning the names of local flora, fauna, and significant landscape features in the Indigenous language, along with their associated stories, traditional uses, and spiritual significance, directly transmits complex ecological understanding and the worldview that often perceives the land and its beings as relatives and teachers. Understanding concepts like the "Seasonal Round" practiced by Northwest tribal peoples 4, in the context of the language used to describe its phases and activities, is a direct immersion into a land-based conceptual framework.

### **D. Integrating Ceremony, Arts, and Holistic Cultural Practices**

Weaving language learning into traditional ceremonies, Indigenous arts (such as carving, weaving, beadwork, painting, song, and dance), and other holistic cultural activities provides a multi-sensory, deeply contextualized, and emotionally resonant learning experience.10 These practices are often non-verbal or para-linguistic expressions of a community's worldview, and when language is integrated, it brings an added layer of meaning and understanding. The Pertame Language Nest, for example, includes traditional songs, dances, nursery rhymes, and art and craft activities in its daily schedule.17 Anishinaabe programs may teach the language in conjunction with the creation and use of cultural objects like ceremonial shakers, or explore cultural activities through the Anishinaabe thirteen-moon cycle.22 The Hawaiian model successfully integrates practices like *hula*, chant, and canoe voyaging into its curriculum 10, while Navajo programs ensure strong cultural connections in their teaching.40 Learning the specific language of a traditional chant or song, for example, as referenced in the context of ancestral teachings 4, also involves learning the spiritual concepts, historical narratives, ethical teachings, and emotional expressions embedded within that particular art form. Core cultural values, such as the Anishinaabe Seven Grandfather Teachings 18 or Hawaiian values like *Aloha ʻĀina* (love and respect for the land) 31, are not just taught abstractly but are lived, expressed, and learned through these integrated cultural and linguistic practices.

The most effective pedagogies for transmitting conceptual frameworks transform language learning from a purely academic exercise into a lived, embodied experience of the culture and its worldview. It is about fostering a state of *being* within the language and culture, rather than simply learning *about* them from an external perspective.3 This aligns closely with traditional Indigenous modes of learning, which are characteristically holistic, experiential, and relational.37 This contrasts significantly with many conventional Western classroom methodologies that tend to decontextualize subject matter and separate knowledge from lived reality. The aim is for the language and its inherent conceptual framework to become an integral part of the learner's identity and way of perceiving and interacting with the world.

Furthermore, a reciprocal and reinforcing relationship exists between language use in culturally authentic contexts and the deepening of conceptual understanding. As learners use the language to participate in traditional activities, ceremonies, or storytelling, their grasp of the underlying worldview strengthens.49 For instance, consistently using traditional kinship terms in their appropriate contexts 49 reinforces a nuanced understanding of complex relational obligations and social structures. Participating in ceremonies using the specific linguistic forms required 22 deepens spiritual understanding and connection. Conversely, as learners achieve a more profound comprehension of the conceptual frameworks—such as the interconnectedness expressed in verb-based languages 5 or the cyclical nature of time embedded in certain oral traditions—they become more adept at using the language in ways that are nuanced, appropriate, and conceptually rich. This positive feedback loop is crucial for developing true fluency that is not only linguistically proficient but also culturally and conceptually grounded, enabling individuals to contribute meaningfully to the continuity of their heritage.

## **V. Key Elements for Sustaining Conceptual Frameworks in Language Revitalization**

The successful revitalization of Indigenous languages, particularly the deep conceptual frameworks they embody, depends on a confluence of critical elements. These factors extend beyond pedagogical techniques to encompass broader community dynamics, historical consciousness, and supportive external structures.

### **A. Community Ownership and Leadership**

The most effective and authentic language revitalization programs are those initiated, led, and controlled by the Indigenous community itself.7 This principle of community ownership ensures that revitalization efforts are intrinsically aligned with the specific values, needs, priorities, and conceptual frameworks of the people whose language and heritage are being nurtured.12 When the community defines which aspects of their worldview are most crucial to transmit and how this should be done, the programs are far more likely to achieve deep and lasting cultural preservation. The TEK-nology project, for example, emphasizes its collective leadership by community participants.21 This grassroots control ensures authenticity, relevance, and a sense of empowerment, fostering greater engagement and commitment from community members.

### **B. Intergenerational Engagement and Transmission**

Actively fostering and maintaining strong connections between Elders—who are often the remaining fluent speakers and primary keepers of traditional knowledge—and younger generations is indispensable for the authentic transmission of language and its embedded conceptual frameworks.7 Elders embody the language in its fullest cultural context, possessing lived experience and a profound understanding of its nuances, subtleties, and spiritual significance.20 Programs that facilitate elder-youth mentorships, involve Elders directly in curriculum development and teaching, and create spaces for intergenerational interaction, such as the Pertame Language Nest where multiple generations participate 44, are crucial for passing on not just words, but the wisdom and worldview they carry.7

### **C. Holistic and Culturally Integrated Approaches**

Language does not exist in a vacuum; it is an integral part of a larger cultural matrix. Therefore, revitalization efforts must be holistic, addressing not only linguistic skills but also cultural identity, spiritual well-being, connection to land and place, traditional arts, governance systems, and healing from historical trauma.7 Successful programs are often shaped around building and strengthening family and community relationships, revitalizing cultural traditions and practices, and re-establishing Indigenous language identity in all facets of life.11 The language must be re-embedded into the daily rhythms and significant events of community life for its conceptual frameworks to remain vibrant and relevant.

### **D. Addressing Historical Trauma and Decolonization**

A candid acknowledgment and active addressing of the historical trauma associated with language loss, cultural suppression, and colonial oppression are often necessary components of successful and meaningful revitalization.7 Language revitalization, in this context, becomes an act of "intentional political resistance" 11 and a process of decolonization.21 It reasserts the validity, value, and resilience of Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and speaking that were systematically targeted for erasure. This process can be profoundly healing for individuals and communities, creating space for renewed pride, agency, and cultural affirmation.18 Recognizing that learning is often "shrouded by generational post-traumatic stress" 11 allows programs to adopt trauma-informed and culturally sensitive approaches.

### **E. Policy, Funding, and Institutional Support**

While community leadership and grassroots efforts are paramount, the sustainability and scalability of language revitalization initiatives often benefit from adequate and consistent funding, supportive governmental policies, and constructive partnerships with educational institutions.2 Challenges such as chronic funding constraints can severely hamper program development and continuity.2 International frameworks like the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirm the right to revitalize and transmit languages.2 Supportive national and regional policies, such as those enabling tribal sovereignty in education 7, can create enabling environments. The Hawaiian model, for instance, benefited significantly from integration into the public school system and the development of university-level teacher training programs.10 However, it is crucial that such external support respects community autonomy and control, as there can be a wariness of school-based efforts if they are not directly guided by the Indigenous community in question.51 The ideal is a balanced partnership where external resources bolster community-defined goals.

The success of these endeavors hinges on understanding that language exists within a complex socio-cultural, political, and economic ecology.10 Revitalizing conceptual frameworks effectively means re-engineering this broader ecology to create supportive niches where the Indigenous language and its associated worldview can genuinely thrive. This involves addressing factors that extend far beyond the classroom or language nest, such as promoting family language policies 7, establishing diverse community domains for everyday language use 11, influencing media representation 1, and creating economic opportunities that value linguistic and cultural skills.1 Simply teaching the language without concurrently transforming the environment where it can be *lived* authentically will inevitably limit the depth and sustainability of conceptual framework transmission.

Ultimately, programs that successfully transmit conceptual frameworks are often those where Indigenous communities are actively reclaiming their agency and exercising their right to self-determination in defining their identity, their educational systems, and their collective future.2 The assertion of rights and the exercise of control over their own cultural and linguistic heritage are fundamental to this process.7 When communities lead, they ensure that the revitalization process itself embodies their conceptual frameworks of governance, decision-making, and relationality, making the journey as important as the destination.

## **VI. Conclusion: Nurturing Living Languages and Enduring Worldviews**

The revitalization of Indigenous languages is an endeavor of profound significance, extending far beyond the preservation of linguistic structures. These languages are irreplaceable repositories of unique human knowledge systems, intricate conceptual frameworks, and diverse ways of understanding and interacting with the world.1 Their renewal is essential not only for the maintenance of global cultural and linguistic diversity but, more critically, for the self-determination, cultural integrity, and holistic well-being of Indigenous peoples themselves. As this report has demonstrated through various case studies, true and lasting revitalization necessitates a dedicated focus on preserving and transmitting the deep conceptual structures and worldviews that give these languages their life and meaning.

The journey of language revitalization is complex and multifaceted, demanding sustained commitment, innovative strategies, and a deep understanding of the symbiotic relationship between language, culture, and thought. Successful programs, such as the Māori *Te Kōhanga Reo* and *Kura Kaupapa Māori*, the Hawaiian *Pūnana Leo* and *Kula Kaiapuni*, Anishinaabemowin initiatives grounded in *Anishinaabe Gikendaasowinan*, Navajo education guided by *Sa'ah Naagháíí Bik'eh Hózhóón*, Sámi *giellabeassi*, and the Pertame Language Nest, all share common threads. They prioritize immersion, intergenerational learning, the centrality of Elders and oral traditions, land-based pedagogy, and the integration of language into holistic cultural practices. Crucially, these initiatives are often underpinned by distinct Indigenous philosophies that serve as blueprints for curriculum, pedagogy, and community engagement, ensuring that the transmission of conceptual frameworks is intentional and authentic.

The "ripple effect" of such conceptually rich revitalization is substantial. Successfully nurturing Indigenous conceptual frameworks through language has been shown to have broad positive impacts on individual and community health, fostering stronger social cohesion, enhancing educational engagement and achievement, and promoting environmental stewardship, as these frameworks often contain profound wisdom regarding sustainable living, relational ethics, and community well-being.1 Investing in programs that preserve conceptual frameworks is, therefore, an investment in healthier, more resilient, and more culturally vibrant Indigenous communities.

Looking forward, there is a clear need for continued and enhanced support, dedicated research, and equitable resource allocation for programs that explicitly prioritize this conceptual depth. The sharing of successful models and the adaptation of effective strategies to diverse local contexts, facilitated by cross-tribal and international collaborations, will be invaluable.7 Technology, when wielded appropriately and led by communities, can also offer supportive tools for documentation, learning, and connection, though it must always serve, rather than supplant, the core principles of culturally grounded, relational pedagogy.7

While the challenges remain significant—including funding insecurities, the limited number of fluent speakers for some languages, and the ongoing pressures of dominant cultures 7—the resilience, innovation, and unwavering dedication demonstrated by Indigenous communities worldwide offer profound hope. These efforts represent a global movement with deeply local imperatives.11 While universal principles and successful models like language nests can be adapted and shared, the specific conceptual frameworks and their modes of transmission must always be authentically rooted in, and defined by, the local Indigenous community whose heritage is being reclaimed. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to revitalizing a worldview. The commitment to nurturing these living languages and their enduring conceptual frameworks is a testament to the enduring strength of Indigenous cultures and their vital importance to the collective heritage of humanity, ensuring that this wisdom continues to inform and enrich future generations.
