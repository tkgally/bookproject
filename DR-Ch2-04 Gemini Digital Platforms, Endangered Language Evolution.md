# **The Digital Crucible: Character Limits, Emoji Systems, and Autocorrect in the Evolution of Endangered Languages**

## **I. Introduction: Digital Platforms and the Shifting Sands of Endangered Language Evolution**

Digital platforms, encompassing the internet and social media, have profoundly reshaped modern language and communication, acting as powerful catalysts for both linguistic innovation and systemic change.1 For endangered languages, these platforms present a significant paradox: they offer unprecedented opportunities for documentation, revitalization, and global connection 1, yet concurrently, they can promote linguistic homogenization and introduce pressures that may accelerate language shift or alter linguistic structures in potentially detrimental ways.1 This duality is central to understanding their impact. While technologies like AI-based translation and speech synthesis offer new avenues for preserving phonetic characteristics and creating digital resources 2, the very architecture of many digital tools can marginalize languages with smaller speaker bases or less digital representation.4

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) framework for language vitality includes "Response to New Domains and Media" (Factor 5\) as a key indicator.6 This factor acknowledges that while some language communities successfully integrate their languages into new media, these platforms often amplify the reach and influence of dominant languages. If endangered language communities fail to engage with modernity using their own languages in these new domains, their languages risk becoming increasingly irrelevant and stigmatized.6 The "mesmerizing power" of dominant languages in new media, such as television and the internet, is a significant concern.6

This report will critically investigate the specific, nuanced effects of three pervasive digital platform features—character limits, emoji systems, and autocorrect/predictive text—on the evolutionary trajectories of endangered languages. It will analyze how these features induce linguistic adaptations, present challenges to orthographic and semantic integrity, offer opportunities for community-driven innovation, and ultimately shape the vitality and digital presence of these vulnerable linguistic systems.

In this report, "evolution" refers to the adaptive changes observed in the linguistic structures (phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, orthography) and usage patterns of endangered languages as they interact with and respond to the affordances and constraints imposed by digital platforms and their specific features. This concept also encompasses shifts in the vitality of these languages, their domains of use 6, and the emergence of new digital vernaculars or hybrid language practices.8 The notion of "digitally-disadvantaged languages" 5 is a critical framework, highlighting the systemic inequities these languages face in terms of digital support, tool design, and online visibility, all of which directly influence their evolutionary paths in the digital age. These languages encounter gaps in digital support obstructing speaker access, poorly-designed tools negatively affecting language integrity, and unique vulnerabilities to surveillance.5

The "dual role" of digital platforms 1 is not a passive state but an active tension. The specific design of platform features, often optimized for dominant languages, acts as a direct evolutionary pressure on endangered languages. This means that the "thriving" of an endangered language online may come at the cost of linguistic adaptations that align it more closely with dominant language structures, potentially leading to a nuanced form of digital assimilation. The interaction between a language's inherent structure and a feature's functional design, which often embodies choices based on high-resource languages 5, subjects endangered languages to pressures that force adaptation. This adaptation can be innovative, such as new slang or creative emoji use, but can also involve simplification or structural changes mimicking dominant language patterns, especially if features penalize complexity.

Furthermore, the digital vitality of an endangered language, as per UNESCO's Factor 5 6, cannot be measured solely by its presence online. The *quality* of that presence, shaped by how platform features constrain or alter the language, is a more critical indicator. A language might be widely used online but in a highly truncated, simplified, or assimilated form, which could be a misleading indicator of true vitality. If features like character limits cause systematic omission of grammatical markers, or autocorrect imposes dominant orthographies, the version of the language "thriving" online may be structurally different from its traditional forms. This necessitates qualitative linguistic analysis of online usage, not just quantitative measures of presence, to accurately assess digital vitality.

The evolution of endangered languages in the digital sphere is inextricably linked to global power dynamics embedded in technological design and dissemination.13 Features are rarely co-designed with minority language communities, creating an inherently uneven digital playing field 5 that shapes their adaptation pathways from the outset. This report will systematically examine the impact of character limits, followed by emoji systems, and then autocorrect and predictive text. A dedicated section will explore the influence of algorithms in content moderation and discoverability. Finally, a synthesis of these influences will be presented, leading to actionable recommendations and a concluding perspective on the future.

## **II. The Constraints of Brevity: Character Limits and Endangered Language Adaptation**

Digital platforms like Twitter, with its historical 140-character limit later expanded to 280 15, and Short Message Service (SMS), traditionally constrained to 160 characters for GSM 7-bit encoding and 70 for non-GSM characters 18, inherently impose strict length limitations. These constraints foster linguistic strategies that prioritize brevity and communicative efficiency.1 This pressure universally leads to common Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) features such as abbreviations, acronyms, phonetic spellings, and neologisms.16 For instance, a study of Dutch tweets revealed a higher prevalence of "textisms"—character-conserving strategies—before Twitter increased its character limit.16 The primary driver for such simplification is often "linguistic economy," favoring speed and adherence to character limitations, a trend particularly embraced by younger generations.23

The impact of these constraints on endangered languages is multifaceted, manifesting in orthographic, grammatical, and lexical adaptations.

### **Linguistic Simplification and Innovation through Abbreviation and Truncation**

In Irish tweets, character limits have spurred innovative phonetic spellings (e.g., gowil for go bhfuil 'that is'), numerical abbreviations (t7ain for tseachtain 'week'), and common acronyms (grma for go raibh maith agat 'thank you').25 The omission of diacritics, crucial for meaning in many languages, is also a common space-saving tactic or a consequence of keyboard limitations. While these adaptations demonstrate linguistic creativity and the resilience of language users 18, they pose a significant risk for endangered languages. If these simplified or altered forms become normalized, particularly among younger, digitally-native speakers, they can lead to the erosion or obscuring of distinctive morphological features or complex orthographies that are vital to the language's integrity.23

### **Grammatical and Syntactic Adjustments under Duress**

Character limits frequently compel users to truncate sentences or produce phrases that might be considered ungrammatical in more formal contexts.25 A key grammatical adaptation is the omission of certain elements. The study on Dutch tweets 16 indicated that after Twitter's character limit was relaxed, tweets contained relatively more articles, conjunctions, and prepositions. This strongly implies these function words were frequently omitted under tighter constraints. The constrained nature of platforms like Twitter thus encourages simplified grammar and syntax.21

For endangered languages, especially those with rich inflectional systems (e.g., case markings, verb conjugations) or polysynthetic structures where multiple morphemes are combined into single words, the consistent omission of these grammatical markers due to character limits could lead to a gradual simplification or restructuring of the language in its digital vernacular. This systematic omission of grammatical categories, if it becomes the primary model for younger learners heavily engaged in digital communication, could influence their overall language acquisition and use, potentially leading to longer-term structural simplification that extends beyond online contexts. The study of Frisian relative pronouns on Twitter 28 illustrates this interplay: while tweets can accommodate complex structures like relative clauses, an ongoing linguistic change (the loss of a final /t/ in certain pronouns) interacts with factors such as phonetic spelling habits (often influenced by the dominant Dutch language) and other morphological elements (like the \-st suffix). This suggests that platform constraints can amplify or intersect with existing language-internal change processes, rather than simply causing superficial lexical shortening.

### **Communicative Strategies in Character-Constrained Environments**

To navigate character limits, users employ various communicative strategies. "Utterance chunking," where messages are broken into smaller, sequential posts, is one such tactic.27 For speakers of endangered languages, these constraints might also necessitate increased code-switching or borrowing from a dominant language if expressing a concept concisely in the endangered language proves difficult within the imposed limit.30 While this is a pragmatic communicative strategy, it can accelerate language shift if it becomes a habitual pattern, reinforcing the dominance of the other language. Furthermore, the very nature of microblog posts—short, unedited, and often idiomatic—makes automated language identification challenging.22 This implies that content in endangered languages, if significantly altered by constraint-driven adaptations, might become less visible to language detection algorithms, thereby hindering research, resource development, and discoverability.

### **Impact on Orthographic Diversity and Standardization Pressures**

The drive for brevity can lead to the adoption of phonetic spellings and the omission of diacritics or special characters essential to an endangered language's orthography, as seen with Irish diacritics.25 This may occur to save characters, for ease of typing on standard keyboards not designed for the language, or due to a lack of awareness of standard forms among users. If an endangered language has a newly standardized or particularly complex orthography, character limits might inadvertently encourage users towards simpler, non-standard written forms. This could undermine community-led standardization efforts or lead to the emergence of a distinct "digital orthography" that diverges from the intended standard, potentially creating confusion for learners and impacting literacy programs.32 The general trend in online interactions towards brevity, adaptability, and informal speech patterns 1 can challenge traditional linguistic norms and the authority of language academies or standardizing bodies. The interplay between character limits and orthographic choices is particularly acute for endangered languages. For those with newly developing orthographies, non-Romanized scripts, or numerous special characters, the pressure for brevity can incentivize users to adopt ad-hoc Romanizations or simplified spellings that are not linguistically sound or community-endorsed, further complicating literacy initiatives.

### **Illustrative Case Studies of Character Limit Impact**

Several studies illustrate these adaptive pressures:

* **Dutch:** The increase in Twitter's character limit from 140 to 280 led to more formal language use, including more frequent inclusion of articles, conjunctions, and prepositions, and a reduction in textisms.16 This suggests that when constraints are relaxed, users may opt for more grammatically complete and formal expressions, implying that the prior omissions were indeed constraint-driven.  
* **Frisian:** Twitter data has been used to study ongoing morphosyntactic changes, such as the loss of final /t/ in relative pronouns.28 While character limits form the backdrop, the research also highlights challenges like data scarcity for low-resource languages and the influence of phonetic spelling habits, often shaped by the dominant Dutch language. Despite limits, the platform was found to accommodate complex sentence structures.  
* **Irish:** On Twitter, character limits contribute to phonetic spellings, the omission of diacritics, and the development of unique abbreviations.25 This demonstrates active and creative linguistic adaptation by users to fit the medium.  
* **Welsh:** Tweets are viewed as providing an authentic snapshot of spoken Welsh, helping linguists identify ongoing syntactic changes precisely because they often bypass the conventions of formal written language, partly due to the inherent brevity of the medium.34

The "linguistic creativity" often celebrated in dominant languages adapting to character limits 18 may have a different, potentially more erosive, impact on endangered languages. For languages with fewer speakers, less institutional support, and ongoing struggles for standardization 32, what appears as innovation in a high-resource language might actually represent a loss of distinctive features or a drift from fragile standard forms in a low-resource one. If digital communication becomes a primary domain of use for an endangered language, especially for youth, and character limits encourage non-standard forms, omissions, or phonetic spellings that deviate from revitalization efforts aimed at teaching the full language, these "innovations" might fragment the language community or hinder literacy efforts.

The "textese" or simplified register emerging from character-constrained digital platforms 37, while potentially having certain cognitive benefits in some contexts 37, could, for endangered languages, lead to a distinct digital vernacular. This digital form might diverge significantly from spoken or traditional written forms, potentially creating a new form of diglossia or accelerating the loss of more complex linguistic features if this digital vernacular becomes the dominant mode of use and transmission among younger speakers.

The following table summarizes observed linguistic adaptations to character limits in several minority languages on digital platforms:

## **III. Picturing Language: Emoji Systems and Their Role in Endangered Linguistic Ecologies**

Emoji systems have become an integral feature of digital communication, offering a visual layer that significantly impacts how language is used and interpreted online. For endangered languages, emojis present a complex interplay of opportunities for enhanced expression and challenges related to cultural representation and linguistic integrity.

### **Emojis as Paralinguistic Cues and Enhancers of Digital Communication**

A primary function of emojis in digital communication is to convey paralinguistic information—emotional tone, sarcasm, humor, and affection—that is typically carried by non-verbal cues like facial expressions, gestures, and intonation in face-to-face interactions but is absent in plain text.38 The use of emojis can reduce ambiguity, enhance the clarity of messages, foster empathy between communicators, and add a layer of personality to digital exchanges.39 This is particularly relevant for speakers of endangered languages, including learners or those who may be less confident in the written form of their language, as emojis can make digital interactions more accessible, engaging, and emotionally resonant. Research involving university students indicates an overwhelmingly positive perception of emojis as tools that improve the effectiveness of digital communication, aid in conveying emotions that are difficult to express solely through text, and even help bridge language barriers, with 89% of respondents in one study affirming this cross-linguistic utility.44 From a functionalist viewpoint, emojis are an addition to the repertoire of paralinguistic cues, often competing with and sometimes replacing other non-standard digital forms like emoticons or expressive spellings to convey non-propositional, interactional meanings.45

### **Semantic Impact: Vocabulary Expansion, Replacement, and Potential Shifts**

Emojis can function as a logographic system, where individual icons replace words or entire phrases, thereby expanding the communicative toolkit.38 A single emoji can efficiently convey an idea or emotion that might otherwise require a lengthy sentence.40 Studies, such as one on Pakistani Facebook users 42, show that younger generations extensively use emojis, sometimes as direct substitutes for words, particularly for emotional expression (e.g., the 'Face with Tears of Joy' emoji for laughter, or sad face emojis for dejection).

This substitutive power, however, raises a critical concern for endangered languages. If standardized, globally recognized emojis begin to habitually replace traditional vocabulary for common emotions, objects, or concepts within endangered language communities, it could lead to lexical attrition in the endangered language itself. This risk is particularly acute if younger speakers, who are often key to intergenerational language transmission, adopt emojis as the primary descriptors for these concepts in their digital interactions, thereby reducing the frequency of use and exposure to the corresponding lexical items in their heritage language.

Furthermore, the meanings of emojis are not static; they can evolve, shift over time, and acquire multiple interpretations (polysemy) depending on context, culture, and specific community usage.47 For instance, research analyzing billions of tweets has shown that while the semantics of most emojis remain relatively stable, some undergo significant changes; the frog emoji, for example, temporarily acquired political connotations, while the skull emoji has evolved to signify figurative death or embarrassment.49 Studies comparing emoji interpretation across languages like English, Portuguese, and Chinese suggest that while literal meanings show fair consistency, figurative uses often correlate with the sentiment of the surrounding context, and some emojis inherently possess higher levels of ambiguity.48 For endangered language communities adopting globally standard emojis, this dynamism means they might also import the evolving semantics and connotations from dominant language discourse. This could potentially overlay or replace indigenous conceptualizations or traditional expressions. Alternatively, these communities might assign unique, localized meanings to standard emojis, creating a distinct "emoji dialect" 50, which itself is a form of linguistic evolution.

### **Cultural Adaptation vs. Universal Standards: The Rise of Indigenous Emojis and the Unicode Challenge**

While some emojis aim for universal understanding 39, their interpretation and appropriateness can vary significantly across different cultural and linguistic contexts.39 Cultural factors, such as the collectivism-individualism spectrum or differing display rules for emotions, heavily influence emoji interpretation and choice.52 The widespread use of standardized Unicode emojis, often reflecting Western or dominant cultural norms, can inadvertently impose these norms on other societies. This is problematic when these emojis lack representations for culturally specific items, concepts, or emotions vital to endangered language communities, potentially leading to feelings of digital marginalization and what has been termed "Western cultural and social behaviour hegemony".54

In response, there has been a rise in Indigenous emoji initiatives. Projects like **Indigemoji** in Australia, serving Arrernte and Kaytetye communities 55, and **Emotikis** in New Zealand, reflecting Māori culture 57, aim to create emoji-like sticker sets that are culturally and linguistically relevant. These initiatives seek to increase cultural representation on digital platforms and provide tools for language learning and youth engagement. They are acts of reclaiming digital space and asserting cultural identity. However, such projects face significant hurdles, including challenges with official adoption into the Unicode standard (the Aboriginal Flag emoji, for example, was rejected by Unicode 56) and difficulties in creating user-friendly, secure emoji keyboards that integrate seamlessly with existing platforms.

The **Unicode Consortium** plays a pivotal role in standardizing characters, including emojis, to ensure global digital representation and interoperability.58 It also contributes to cultural preservation by encoding scripts for minority and historical languages.59 Nevertheless, concerns persist that the intense focus on encoding new emojis might divert crucial resources from the encoding of scripts for the vast number of "digitally disadvantaged" languages—estimated at nearly 98% of the world's living languages.58 The complex and lengthy approval process for new emojis 56 can also create barriers for minority communities seeking official digital representation of their unique symbols. This situation highlights a potential misalignment of priorities within the standardization body, where the expansion of a universal symbol set might overshadow the foundational needs of linguistic diversity.

The development and promotion of Indigenous emoji sets can be seen as more than just a quest for representation; it is a form of digital linguistic activism and an assertion of cultural sovereignty in digital spaces. These initiatives actively challenge the perceived neutrality and universality of standardized emoji sets, which often reflect dominant cultural perspectives. By creating their own emoji sets, communities reclaim digital space, assert their cultural identity, and ensure their languages and cultural concepts are visible and usable in digital communication, often bypassing potentially exclusionary formal systems.

### **Competition with and Displacement of Other Non-Standard Digital Forms**

Standardized emojis, often disseminated "from above" due to their institutionalized adoption via Unicode, are in direct competition with, and can displace, earlier, user-generated paralinguistic cues such as emoticons (e.g., :-)) and non-standard spellings (e.g., expressive lengthening like "soooo").45 Research indicates that as users adopt emojis, their use of emoticons dramatically decreases, alongside an increase in the use of standard spellings. This suggests that emojis are outcompeting these "change from below" forms for the same communicative functions.

For endangered language communities, this "competition" dynamic is significant. If these communities have organically developed their own unique digital vernaculars, textisms, or local emoticon conventions, the pervasive influx and ease of use of standardized emojis might supplant these emergent forms. This could lead to a loss of unique digital expressions specific to that community, favoring a more globally uniform set of paralinguistic tools, and potentially stifling nascent, language-specific digital creativity before it becomes established.

Furthermore, while emojis can aid cross-linguistic communication 44, an over-reliance on *standard* emojis to bridge communication gaps with dominant language speakers might inadvertently reduce the incentive or perceived need for endangered language speakers to use or for others to learn the endangered language's actual vocabulary for emotions or concepts represented by those emojis. If a speaker can use a universally understood emoji instead of recalling or typing a specific endangered language term, especially in mixed-language digital conversations, the emoji becomes a path of least resistance. Over time, this could subtly decrease the active use and transmission of certain lexical items in the endangered language within digital contexts.

The following table summarizes key community-driven emoji initiatives for endangered languages:

Table 2: Community-Driven Emoji Initiatives for Endangered Languages

| Initiative Name/Language(s) | Key Aims & Cultural Significance | Development Approach | Challenges Encountered | Platform/Availability | Source IDs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Indigemoji / Arrernte & Kaytetye (Australia) | Represent local culture, Youth engagement, Language learning aid, Increase digital representation | Community workshops with elders and youth, Artist collaboration, Graphic design support | Unicode adoption for specific symbols (e.g., Aboriginal Flag rejected), Keyboard integration (user-friendliness, security), Funding | Sticker app (iOS, Android), Signal stickers | 55 |
| Emotikis / Māori (New Zealand) | Reflect Māori culture, Provide Māori youth with culturally relevant online signifiers, Share meaning of Māori words and concepts | Designed by Te Puia Māori cultural center | Not detailed in snippets, but likely similar to Indigemoji regarding Unicode/integration | Emoticon set, animated GIFs | 57 |

## **IV. Autocorrect and Predictive Text: Navigating Assistance and Assimilation Pressures**

Autocorrect and predictive text are ubiquitous features on digital platforms, designed to enhance typing speed and accuracy. However, for speakers of endangered languages, these tools often present a complex mix of potential assistance and significant assimilation pressures, largely due to their development and training on dominant language data.

### **Orthographic Challenges for Non-Standard and Minority Orthographies**

Autocorrect and predictive text systems are overwhelmingly trained on vast datasets from dominant languages like English.5 This foundational bias leads to a lack of support or suboptimal performance for endangered languages, particularly those with unique orthographies, non-standard spellings, or scripts that are not well-represented in the training data.5 As noted, "poorly-designed digital tools that negatively affect the integrity of languages and writing systems" include autocorrect and spell-check, which can degrade a language's orthography if not developed with careful consideration for low-resource languages.5 Technology like autocorrect tends to reinforce standard spellings of dominant languages and can misinterpret user intent if the typed language is unsupported or poorly supported.62

Specific orthographic features of endangered languages—such as diacritics, unique characters, tonal markers, or distinct grapheme-phoneme correspondences—are frequently miscorrected, ignored, or simply not recognized by these systems.64 For example, a study on Croatian (while not endangered, illustrative of orthographic complexity) highlighted issues with diacritic confusion (e.g., "č" for "ć") and grammatical forms being misidentified by spellcheckers not attuned to Croatian linguistic structures.66 Similarly, dominant language orthographies (e.g., Malay) have been shown to influence the transcription of minority languages (e.g., Tutong, Brunei Malay), leading to the omission of necessary symbols (like the glottal stop) or the imposition of dominant language phonology and morphology.64 Autocorrect systems based on these dominant languages would inevitably exacerbate such distortions. The usability of keyboards is also critical; if a keyboard layout is difficult or ill-suited to an endangered language's orthography, the community may not adopt it, regardless of autocorrect features.67

### **Dominant Language Bias and Miscorrection**

A common and frustrating experience for speakers of endangered languages is the tendency of autocorrect systems to "correct" words in their language to words in a dominant language, typically English.63 This often occurs if the user's keyboard settings include multiple languages, or if the system defaults to a dominant language when encountering unfamiliar strings. User experiences, even in well-resourced languages, demonstrate this problem: autocorrect might change words to the wrong language (e.g., capitalizing the German "Niveau" in a Danish text or changing the English "gimme" to the Danish "glemme").68 This phenomenon is analogous to biases found in Large Language Models, such as the preference for White Mainstream English (WME) over African American Language (AAL).63

Such miscorrections are not merely an inconvenience; they can impede clear communication and subtly reinforce the notion that the endangered language is "incorrect," "non-standard," or not "fit" for digital environments.5 For instance, a user attempting to type in Ainu reported that the spellchecker would flag Ainu words as errors if they didn't conform to English patterns, even if they were valid Ainu words that coincidentally resembled short English words.70 This illustrates how dominant language dictionaries embedded in spellcheckers can misidentify and penalize valid minority language forms, potentially leading to a form of "digital linguistic insecurity" among speakers. If users constantly battle autocorrect or see their language forms flagged as errors, they may doubt their own orthographic knowledge or feel their language is unwelcome in digital spaces, which can discourage its use and contribute to language shift.

### **Lexical Diversity and Assimilation Pressures**

If users consistently accept miscorrections from a dominant language or adapt their spelling in the endangered language to avoid triggering such miscorrections, it can lead to the gradual assimilation of dominant language vocabulary or orthographic conventions into the endangered language's digital usage.62 Predictive text functionalities, by predominantly suggesting words from the dominant language, can further reduce the visibility and active use of endangered language equivalents.63 While lexical adaptation strategies are highly variable and conditioned by extralinguistic factors such as user attitudes and digital literacy 71, the pervasive suggestions from dominant-language-biased systems can subtly steer users away from their native lexicon. The concept of "lexical purity" 72, often a concern in language revitalization, is directly challenged as autocorrect might inadvertently promote loanwords or dominant language forms over indigenous terms.

Furthermore, the "learning" capability of many autocorrect and predictive text systems 73, which adapt to user input over time, presents a nuanced challenge. If not carefully managed, or if the input data from which the system learns is heavily skewed by dominant language interference (e.g., users frequently typing endangered language words with simplified orthography or borrowed morphology due to habit or ease), the system could inadvertently "learn" and then propagate these incorrect or assimilated forms within the endangered language user community. This could accelerate the assimilation of dominant language features into the digital vernacular of the endangered language, as the system begins to suggest these compromised forms to other users.

### **Community-Driven Solutions and Technological Adaptations**

Recognizing these challenges, communities and researchers have been proactive in developing tailored solutions:

* **Custom Keyboards and Input Methods:** The development of custom keyboard layouts designed for the specific orthographic needs of endangered languages is a critical step. Examples include the Cherokee phonetic keyboard, developed with community input because the standard syllabary layout was difficult for many to remember 75, and proposed DVORAK-based or modified QWERTY layouts for Quechua, which has unique phonetic demands ill-suited to standard QWERTY.77 These custom layouts have shown improvements in typing speed and error rates for Quechua users.77  
* **Specialized Spellcheckers and Autocorrect Systems:** Creating bespoke spellcheckers and autocorrect systems for endangered languages is a more intensive but highly effective approach. This often requires significant effort in lexicon building, defining grammatical rules, and compiling corpora of common errors. The development of a spell checker for Wolof, a low-resource language, utilized a trie data structure, dynamic programming, and the weighted Levenshtein distance, alongside a community-sourced Wolof lexicon and a corpus of misspelled words, achieving high accuracy despite limited initial data.79  
* **AI and NLP for Low-Resource Languages:** Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing tools, including Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored for creating resources like spell-checkers, automatic translators, and editing tools for low-resource and endangered languages.2 Fine-tuning LLMs with even small amounts of data from Indigenous languages is showing promise.81 Some applications, like the "Drops Learn Ainu Language" app, bypass keyboard input issues altogether by using image-based learning.83

The development of such community-led autocorrect and keyboard solutions is not merely a technical fix; it is an act of *technological self-determination* and a crucial step in asserting the language's legitimacy and usability in the digital realm. These efforts reclaim agency from dominant technological paradigms and can significantly increase a language's prestige and utility online, countering the negative impacts of biased mainstream tools.

The success of any autocorrect or predictive text system for an endangered language fundamentally hinges on the availability of sufficient, high-quality, and representative digital data for that language. This creates a challenging feedback loop: languages with more digital resources tend to get better technological support, which in turn encourages more digital use and content creation, further enriching their resources. Endangered languages are often caught on the disadvantaged side of this loop, making community-driven data creation, lexicon building, and tool development even more critical for breaking this cycle.2 The paramount importance of community involvement in all stages of developing these tools—from design to data collection and testing—cannot be overstated, as it ensures accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and ultimate adoption by the users.12

The following table outlines some challenges and solutions related to autocorrect and predictive text for endangered languages:

Table 3: Autocorrect/Predictive Text: Challenges and Solutions for Endangered Languages

## **V. Algorithmic Influence: Content Moderation, Discoverability, and the Digital Visibility of Endangered Languages**

Beyond the direct linguistic effects of input features, the broader algorithmic ecosystem of digital platforms significantly shapes the experience of endangered language communities online. Content moderation systems and content discovery algorithms, often powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), play a crucial role in determining what is seen, shared, and even permissible, with profound implications for the digital visibility and expression of endangered languages.

### **Content Moderation Bias and its Impact on Endangered Language Expression**

Content moderation, essential for managing online discourse, increasingly relies on AI and LLMs. However, these systems are predominantly trained on data from dominant languages, often leading to a lack of nuance and cultural understanding when applied to low-resource or endangered languages.88 For instance, Tamil, despite having millions of speakers, is considered a "low-resource language" in the context of automated content moderation. Global moderation strategies frequently involve machine-translating content into English for review, a process fraught with errors for languages like Tamil, leading to inaccurate moderation decisions.89 LLM-based moderation is particularly unreliable for non-dominant languages, often reflecting biases embedded in their training data, which may be rooted in colonial and imperialist dynamics, resulting in discriminatory outcomes and significant performance gaps compared to dominant languages.88

This systemic bias can lead to the erroneous flagging or removal of legitimate content in endangered languages. This is especially true if the content contains culturally specific expressions, discussions of sensitive historical or political topics relevant to the community, or non-standard orthographies that automated systems might misinterpret as policy violations or spam.88 The perception, or reality, of unfair censorship, "deplatforming," or "shadowbanning" (where content visibility is reduced without explicit notification) can stifle expression and lead to self-censorship among speakers of endangered languages, who may fear their contributions will be misunderstood or penalized.89 Digitally-disadvantaged languages face a dual challenge: platforms may fail to adequately moderate harmful content *in* these languages (leading to the spread of hate speech or misinformation within the community), while simultaneously *over-moderating* legitimate expression due to a lack of linguistic and cultural understanding by the moderation systems.5 Inaccurate or biased content moderation, therefore, acts as a direct mechanism of *digital language suppression*. It not only removes content but also creates an environment where speakers may feel their language is unwelcome, misunderstood, or inherently problematic on the platform, directly impacting the language's digital vitality and discouraging its use.

### **Algorithmic Amplification and Discoverability**

Social media algorithms, particularly those driving news feeds and recommendation engines, determine content visibility and distribution, primarily by optimizing for user engagement.90 These algorithms are typically trained on user behavior patterns and content characteristics prevalent in dominant languages and cultures. Consequently, content in endangered languages, which naturally has a smaller potential user base and may generate less engagement by global metrics, often struggles for visibility and discoverability, even among individuals actively interested in the language or community.11 This creates an "uneven digital playing field" 5, where the linguistic richness of smaller communities is drowned out by the sheer volume and algorithmic preference for mainstream content.

Algorithmic filtering can inadvertently create "echo chambers" or "filter bubbles," limiting users' exposure to diverse viewpoints, including content from or about minority cultures and languages.93 While social media platforms have the potential to amplify marginalized voices, inherent algorithmic biases can also sideline these perspectives if they do not align with engagement-maximizing criteria. The lack of digital representation and discoverability can accelerate language shift, particularly among younger generations, who may perceive their ancestral language as less relevant or useful if it remains largely invisible in their online experiences.11 The "discoverability" problem for endangered language content is thus not merely a function of small speaker numbers but is actively exacerbated by engagement-driven algorithms that favor mainstream content. This can create a vicious cycle: low visibility leads to low engagement, which in turn signals to the algorithm to further deprioritize such content, making it increasingly difficult for learners, community members, and revitalization efforts to find and connect with relevant linguistic and cultural materials online.

### **Platform Governance and its Impact on Minority Language Expression**

The concentration of power in a few large technology platforms and the foundational LLM models they deploy means that their design choices and content policies have an outsized impact on global online speech norms, including those affecting endangered languages.88 This can lead to an "algorithmic monoculture," where the digital landscape is shaped by a limited set of linguistic and cultural perspectives. Furthermore, regulations like the EU's Geo-blocking Regulation, while intended for market fairness, can inadvertently discriminate against linguistic minorities by limiting their access to cultural and media content in their native languages if that content originates from kin-states or other regions outside their current location.96 This restricts access to education, entertainment, and cultural expression, potentially weakening cultural identity preservation.

The push for "global" or "language-agnostic" moderation policies by major platforms 89, while seemingly aiming for uniformity and efficiency, inherently disadvantages low-resource languages. In practice, "language-agnostic" often defaults to dominant language (e.g., English) norms, tools, and reviewer capabilities. If the underlying systems for translation, analysis, and review are not equally proficient across all languages, endangered languages are effectively judged by standards and through linguistic lenses not their own, leading to systemic misinterpretations and unfair moderation outcomes. True linguistic equity in the digital sphere requires language-specific, culturally-aware approaches to platform governance and content moderation. The development of community-led initiatives and culturally informed moderation practices, particularly those emerging from the Global Majority, offers a more inclusive and rights-respecting path forward.88 Platform governance models that do not actively incorporate principles of linguistic equity and fail to invest adequately in resources for low-resource languages will, regardless of the positive potential of other platform features, inadvertently contribute to the digital marginalization and potential accelerated endangerment of these languages.

## **VI. Synthesis: The Tripartite Influence on Endangered Language Trajectories**

The preceding sections have detailed how character limits, emoji systems, and autocorrect/predictive text features, alongside overarching algorithmic governance, individually and collectively shape the digital environment for endangered languages. These features are not isolated in their impact; they interact in complex ways to influence linguistic structures, user behaviors, and community responses. For instance, the pressure for brevity imposed by character limits might encourage the use of emojis as a semantic or emotional shorthand. Simultaneously, autocorrect systems, often biased towards dominant languages, may misinterpret both the abbreviated text created under character constraints and the intended meaning of culturally adapted or novel emoji use. This can lead to a cascade of effects: character limits drive orthographic and grammatical simplifications; autocorrect may then attempt to "correct" these adapted forms, or even the language's original orthography, towards dominant language norms, further eroding unique features. Emojis might be adopted to compensate for nuanced meanings lost due to truncation, but if globally standardized emojis replace indigenous terms for emotions or concepts, lexical diversity within the endangered language can suffer.

This dynamic interplay highlights that the evolution of endangered languages in digital spaces is a complex adaptive system. The language changes in response to technological pressures, but these changes, in turn, influence user behavior and community strategies, creating feedback loops. These loops can be virtuous, leading to revitalization and innovation (e.g., community-developed keyboards 75 increasing language use), or vicious, contributing to further endangerment and assimilation (e.g., persistent autocorrect frustration 68 leading to abandonment of typing in the endangered language).

A crucial aspect of this digital evolution is the interplay between technological affordances, user agency, and community efforts. The features and inherent biases of digital platforms set the stage, creating a specific set of constraints and opportunities.1 However, users are not passive recipients. User agency is evident in creative adaptations, the development of digital vernaculars (including hybrid language practices and online slang, particularly among youth), and strategic code-switching.9 Indigenous youth, for example, are often at the forefront of mediating new technologies and localizing media for specific cultural purposes, fostering the emergence of hybrid forms and non-standard structures in out-of-school settings where motivation for L1 written self-expression can be high despite limited pedagogical support.9

Community efforts are paramount in navigating this landscape. Proactive engagement, such as media in unique minority languages like Basque, Ladin, and Upper Sorbian making their texts available for the development of translation tools, demonstrates institutional adaptation to the digital age.35 The development of tailored tools like custom keyboards, specialized spellcheckers, and culturally relevant emojis, as well as advocacy for better digital support, are vital counter-responses to the pressures of dominant technologies.2

The cumulative impact of these digital features and responses significantly affects language vitality, intergenerational transmission, and overall digital presence. A hostile or difficult digital environment can push younger generations towards dominant languages online, thereby weakening intergenerational transmission of the endangered language.11 A weak, distorted, or invisible digital presence can render a language irrelevant in increasingly central domains of modern life, further marginalizing it.5 Conversely, a strong, positive, and authentic digital presence—supported by appropriate, community-vetted tools and active community engagement—can enhance the prestige of an endangered language, create new domains for its use, and contribute to its revitalization.1

The digital manifestations of endangered languages, shaped by the features discussed, can become de facto standards for younger generations, especially if formal language education and traditional domains of use are weak or inaccessible.6 If the primary exposure to written or interactive forms of the endangered language for youth occurs mainly through digital platforms, the versions of the language molded by character limits, emoji conventions, and autocorrect behavior might become their principal linguistic model. This could lead to a significant divergence between the "digital vernacular" of the endangered language and other forms, such as the language spoken by elders or documented by linguists, potentially creating a new kind of diglossia or accelerating the loss of more complex or traditional forms if the digital variant becomes dominant.

Therefore, assessing the true impact of these digital features requires a holistic approach that considers not just linguistic changes in isolation, but also crucial sociolinguistic factors. These include speaker attitudes towards their language and its digital forms, community goals for revitalization, the availability of resources for digital development and literacy, and the power dynamics inherent in the global digital ecosystem. Without this comprehensive perspective, there is a risk of misinterpreting adaptation as solely decay or, conversely, innovation, without understanding its deeper implications for the language's future.

The following table provides a summary of the dichotomous effects of the key digital platform features discussed:

Table 4: Overview of Digital Platform Features and Their Dichotomous Effects on Endangered Languages

| Feature | Potential Positive Impacts/Opportunities for Endangered Languages | Potential Negative Impacts/Challenges for Endangered Languages |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Character Limits** | Fosters linguistic creativity and innovation (abbreviations, neologisms) 18; Encourages concise communication; Can reflect authentic spoken language patterns 34; May lead to development of unique digital vernaculars. | Forces grammatical simplification/truncation (omission of function words, morphemes) 16; Can erode distinctive morphological/orthographic features 23; May pressure users towards non-standard forms, undermining standardization efforts.32 |
| **Emoji Systems** | Enhance emotional expression and reduce ambiguity in text 39; Can bridge language barriers 44; Allow for culturally specific expression through custom emojis (e.g., Indigemoji, Emotikis) 55; Foster engagement. | Standard emojis may impose dominant cultural norms 54; Can lead to lexical attrition if emojis replace EL words 42; Interpretation varies culturally, risking miscommunication 52; Standard emojis may displace unique user-generated digital forms.45 |
| **Autocorrect/Predictive Text** | Can assist with spelling and speed up typing if well-supported; Community-developed tools can reinforce correct orthography (e.g., Wolof spellchecker).79 | Often biased towards dominant languages, leading to miscorrection of EL words 68; Can degrade EL orthography and integrity 5; May cause "digital linguistic insecurity" \[Implied\]; Can promote assimilation of dominant language forms/lexicon.62 |

## **VII. Charting a Course: Recommendations for Technology, Policy, and Community Action**

The complex interplay between digital platform features and the evolution of endangered languages necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach to mitigate challenges and harness opportunities. Effective strategies require coordinated efforts from platform developers, policymakers, linguists, and, most crucially, the language communities themselves. The overarching goal should be to foster digital linguistic equity and sovereignty, empowering communities to shape their languages' futures in the digital realm.

### **For Platform Developers and Technologists:**

1. **Prioritize Low-Resource Languages in Tool Development:** Actively invest in research and development to improve support for endangered and low-resource languages within core platform features like autocorrect, predictive text, and speech-to-text systems.2 This includes dedicated efforts to build comprehensive and representative datasets for these languages, which are foundational for AI model training.85  
2. **Design for Linguistic Flexibility:** Offer more flexible character input solutions and, where feasible, adjustable or context-sensitive character limits. Explore alternative input methods that are less constraining for languages with complex scripts (e.g., non-Roman based) or polysynthetic structures.  
3. **Support Culturally Relevant Symbols and Emojis:** Collaborate proactively with language communities and the Unicode Consortium to facilitate the timely inclusion of culturally significant symbols and ensure robust rendering support for diverse scripts.58 Provide tools and platforms that allow communities to easily create, share, and integrate their own specific sticker sets or emojis into messaging applications.56  
4. **Implement Robust Bias Mitigation Strategies:** Develop and deploy advanced bias detection and mitigation techniques for autocorrect algorithms to reduce dominant language bias and prevent the miscorrection of endangered language words. For content moderation, invest in language-specific AI models and culturally informed human review teams who possess linguistic expertise in relevant endangered languages.88  
5. **Promote Openness and Collaboration:** Where appropriate and with community consent, open up APIs and provide access to anonymized linguistic data that can help communities and researchers develop their own language tools and resources.100  
6. **Enhance User Configurability:** Provide users with greater control over autocorrect aggressiveness, the sources for predictive text suggestions, and the dictionaries their input tools utilize. Allow for easy switching between language keyboards and spellcheckers without defaulting to dominant languages.

### **For Policymakers (Governmental and Institutional):**

1. **Fund Language Technology Initiatives:** Allocate public and private funding specifically for research, development, and deployment of language technologies tailored for endangered languages.3 This includes supporting the creation of digital infrastructure such as corpora and lexical databases.101  
2. **Promote Digital Literacy in Endangered Languages:** Support and fund educational programs that equip community members, especially youth and elders, with the skills to use digital tools effectively for language documentation, content creation, online communication, and revitalization activities.13  
3. **Advocate for Linguistic Diversity in Digital Standards:** Actively engage with international standards bodies like the Unicode Consortium to ensure that the needs of endangered language communities are adequately addressed concerning script encoding, character representation, and keyboard layouts.60  
4. **Address Algorithmic Bias and Content Moderation Inequities:** Develop regulations, ethical guidelines, or co-regulatory frameworks that encourage transparency, accountability, and fairness in algorithmic content moderation systems, with specific provisions for protecting expression in non-dominant and endangered languages.88  
5. **Support Open Data and Resource Sharing:** Foster policies that encourage the creation, maintenance, and ethical sharing of open linguistic datasets and resources for endangered languages, respecting Indigenous data sovereignty principles.86

### **For Linguists and Language Researchers:**

1. **Document Digital Language Practices:** Conduct in-depth sociolinguistic and corpus-based research on how endangered languages are adapting in diverse digital spaces, specifically analyzing the effects of platform features on linguistic structure and use.1  
2. **Foster Collaborative Partnerships:** Work in equitable partnerships with language communities and technologists to co-design and develop digital tools and resources that are effective, culturally appropriate, and align with community goals.2  
3. **Develop Best Practices for Digital Orthographies:** Provide expert guidance on creating, adapting, or standardizing orthographies for digital use, considering issues of phonemic representation, consistency, ease of input on various devices, and community acceptance.32  
4. **Uphold Ethical Standards:** Ensure all research and development activities are conducted ethically, prioritizing community ownership of language data, informed consent, and Indigenous intellectual property rights.82

### **For Language Communities and Activists:**

1. **Lead Digital Language Initiatives:** Take an active role in initiating, managing, and guiding the development of digital resources and tools for their languages, ensuring these projects are grounded in community needs and values.3  
2. **Create and Promote Digital Content:** Generate a diverse range of digital content in the endangered language (e.g., social media posts, videos, blogs, educational materials, music) to increase its visibility, provide valuable resources for learners, and normalize its use in contemporary domains.35  
3. **Champion Digital Literacy and Engagement:** Encourage all community members, particularly youth, to use the language online and to develop the digital literacy skills necessary to navigate these platforms effectively and safely.9  
4. **Advocate for Linguistic Needs:** Clearly articulate the community's needs to platform developers, policymakers, and researchers regarding tool support, fair content moderation, and equitable digital representation.  
5. **Consider Developing Digital Style Guides:** Communities may find it beneficial to collaboratively develop guidelines for how their language is used in digital contexts, addressing common abbreviations, emoji use, and orthographic conventions to maintain consistency and intelligibility, if this aligns with their revitalization goals.

These recommendations are interconnected; technological solutions alone are insufficient without community engagement, supportive policies, and ongoing linguistic research. For example, developing a new keyboard for an endangered language (a technological solution) requires community input on its design and orthographic representation (community involvement and linguistic analysis), potential funding (policy), and research into its usability and impact (linguistics). A foundational principle for all these actions should be the promotion of *digital linguistic sovereignty* for endangered language communities. This means empowering them to make informed decisions about how their languages are represented, used, and evolved in digital spaces, and ensuring they have the necessary resources and agency to implement those decisions, rather than being passive recipients of technologies designed for others.

## **VIII. Conclusion: The Evolving Symbiosis of Digital Platforms and Linguistic Futures**

The investigation into the specific effects of character limits, emoji systems, and autocorrect/predictive text features reveals a complex and dynamic interplay with the evolution of endangered languages. These digital mechanisms, often designed with dominant languages in mind, are not neutral conduits of communication but active agents that shape linguistic expression, orthographic practices, and lexical choices. Character limits drive innovative abbreviations and grammatical simplifications; emoji systems offer new paralinguistic and semantic dimensions while posing challenges of cultural representation; and autocorrect/predictive text features can both assist and assimilate, often reflecting dominant linguistic norms. The overarching algorithmic environment further influences the visibility and viability of endangered languages online through content moderation and discoverability mechanisms.

The impact of these features is not monolithic. It varies significantly based on the specific linguistic typology of the endangered language, the digital literacy and agency of its speech community, the availability of tailored technological resources, and the community's own goals for language maintenance and revitalization. Speakers of endangered languages are not merely passive recipients of these technological pressures; they actively adapt, innovate, and resist, creating new digital vernaculars and leveraging platforms for connection and cultural expression.1 Community-led initiatives to develop custom keyboards, culturally relevant emojis, and language-specific autocorrect tools are testaments to this agency and the desire for digital self-determination.55

The relationship between digital platforms and endangered languages is an ongoing, co-evolutionary process. While digital tools offer unprecedented opportunities for documentation, learning, and revitalization 1, they also carry inherent risks of accelerated language shift, structural simplification, or cultural misrepresentation if not navigated with awareness and intention.4 The "evolution" of endangered languages in these digital spaces is not necessarily a purely Darwinian "survival of the fittest," where languages must unilaterally adapt or face extinction. Instead, it is a process that can, and should, be actively shaped and guided by informed human intervention. This includes ethical technology design that accounts for linguistic diversity, supportive policies that allocate resources equitably, and community-led strategies that define the terms of digital engagement.

The future vitality of many endangered languages will be significantly determined by their ability to establish a meaningful, functional, and authentic presence in the digital realm. The specific platform features analyzed in this report—character limits, emoji systems, and autocorrect—serve as critical gatekeepers to this presence. If these core features make it difficult, frustrating, or distorting to use an endangered language online, its digital footprint will remain weak, potentially leading to perceptions of irrelevance among younger generations and accelerating its decline.11

Charting a path forward requires a commitment to digital linguistic equity. This involves continuous re-evaluation of how technology impacts linguistic diversity, recognizing that even seemingly minor platform features can have profound, long-term consequences for languages with fewer speakers and resources. Tech companies, policymakers, researchers, and language communities must collaborate to create a more inclusive digital world—one where all languages have the tools and the space to adapt, innovate, and thrive, ensuring that the digital crucible forges new strengths rather than hastening obsolescence. A proactive, rather than reactive, approach that prioritizes linguistic justice is essential not merely for preserving the past, but for ensuring that endangered languages have vibrant and evolving futures in all communicative domains, including the digital.
