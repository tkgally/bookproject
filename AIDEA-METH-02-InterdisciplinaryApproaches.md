## 2. Complementary Relationships Between Disciplines

### 2.1 Linguistics + Archaeology
**Source**: Gemini report

**Synergies**:
- Reconstructed proto-lexemes can be correlated with archaeological findings
- Material culture can confirm or challenge linguistic reconstructions
- Dating convergence: archaeological chronology meets linguistic time-depth

**Example Integration**:
"The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European word for 'wheel' aligns with archaeological evidence for the spread of wheeled vehicles."

### 2.2 Ethnohistory + Oral Tradition + Linguistics
**Source**: Gemini report

**Synergies**:
- Colonial documents provide external view of Indigenous concepts
- Oral traditions preserve insider understanding
- Linguistic analysis reveals deeper meanings in both sources

**Integration Strategy**:
"Ethnohistorical analysis of colonial documents describing a particular Indigenous ritual can be enriched by collecting surviving oral traditions about that ritual from community elders, and further illuminated by linguistic analysis of the specific terms used."

### 2.3 Digital Humanities + All Other Disciplines
**Source**: All reports

**Synergies**:
- DH provides computational infrastructure for all fields
- Enables pattern detection across massive datasets
- Facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration through shared platforms
- Preserves and disseminates findings

**Key Functions**:
- Data integration from multiple sources
- Pattern recognition at scale
- Collaborative platforms
- Visualization of complex relationships

### 2.4 Cognitive Science + Historical Linguistics
**Source**: ChatGPT report

**Synergies**:
- Linguistic structures reveal cognitive patterns
- Cognitive constraints explain linguistic universals
- Together they illuminate the language-thought interface

## 3. Integrated Methodological Frameworks

### 3.1 Conceptual Stratigraphy
**Source**: Gemini report

A method that layers different forms of evidence chronologically:

**Process**:
1. Establish chronological framework
2. Layer linguistic evidence (oldest to newest)
3. Add archaeological material culture
4. Incorporate textual/documentary evidence
5. Include oral traditions and ethnographic data
6. Analyze patterns across layers

**Analogy**: "This is analogous to archaeological stratigraphy, where different layers represent different time periods."

### 3.2 The Consilience Approach
**Source**: Claude report, Gemini report

Using multiple lines of independent evidence to strengthen conclusions:

**Principle**: When different methodologies point to the same conclusion, confidence increases
**Application**: A concept's existence is more certain when supported by:
- Linguistic reconstruction
- Archaeological evidence
- Textual references
- Oral traditions

### 3.3 Conceptual Triangulation
**Source**: Gemini report

**Definition**: Using converging evidence from at least three different methodological approaches

**Components**:
1. **Linguistic Evidence**: Etymology, reconstructed forms, semantic fields
2. **Archaeological Evidence**: Material culture, spatial patterns, iconography
3. **Ethnographic Evidence**: Oral traditions, cultural practices, indigenous knowledge

**Critical for**: Concepts from non-literate societies with sparse direct evidence

## 4. Practical Integration Strategies

### 4.1 Interdisciplinary Team Composition
**Source**: Gemini report, ChatGPT report

**Recommended Team Structure**:
- Historical linguist (for deep-time reconstruction)
- Archaeologist (for material evidence)
- Anthropologist (for cultural context)
- Digital humanist (for computational analysis)
- Community representative (for ethical guidance and insider knowledge)

### 4.2 Boundary Objects
**Source**: Gemini report

Using specific artifacts or texts that all specialists can examine from their perspectives:

**Function**: Anchors collaboration and ensures teams are analyzing the same phenomenon
**Examples**:
- A specific archaeological artifact
- A historical text
- A linguistic construction
- A cultural practice

### 4.3 Sequential Integration
**Source**: Multiple reports

**Workflow Example**:
1. Linguists identify potential lost concept through comparative reconstruction
2. Archaeologists search for material correlates
3. Anthropologists investigate surviving cultural practices
4. Digital humanists analyze patterns across all data
5. Philosophers provide conceptual framework
6. Team synthesizes findings

### 4.4 Parallel Investigation
